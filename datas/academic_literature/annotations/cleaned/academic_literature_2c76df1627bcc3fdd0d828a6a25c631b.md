#### Abstract

The photoinduced absorption in a Ca-doped bismuth titanate crystal is measured as a function of temperature in the red $(660 \mathrm{~nm})$, yellow $(570 \mathrm{~nm})$, and green $(505 \mathrm{~nm})$ spectral regions.


## INTRODUCTION

Photorefractive $\mathrm{Bi}_{12} \mathrm{MO}_{20}(\mathrm{M}=\mathrm{Si}, \mathrm{Ge}, \mathrm{Ti})$ sillenites are promising materials for dynamic holography $[1-6]$ and related applications owing to their fast photoresponse. Bismuth titanate, $\mathrm{Bi}_{12} \mathrm{TiO}_{20}$, crystals offer the advantages of low optical rotation and high photosensitivity in the visible and near-IR spectral regions $[1,7]$. Optical absorption has a significant effect on the performance of photorefractive devices, and its temperature variation determines the temperature range of their normal operation.

Yet another salient feature of bismuth titanate is the significant photoinduced absorption in the visible range [2, 8-15], which is believed to result from photoinduced charge transfer between defect centers with different photoionization cross sections [8-14]. The concentration of such centers, the probabilities of the photoexcitation and thermal generation of nonequilibrium charge carriers and intracenter transitions, and recombination coefficients govern the dynamics and magnitude of photoinduced absorption [15] and may depend on temperature. The temperature-dependent optical absorption spectra of bismuth silicate and germanate crystals were studied in detail by Panchenko [16-18].

The purpose of this work was to measure the temperature-dependent absorption coefficient of $\mathrm{Bi}_{12} \mathrm{TiO}_{20}(\mathrm{Ca}\rangle$ in the red $(660 \mathrm{~nm})$, yellow $(570 \mathrm{~nm})$, and green $(505 \mathrm{~nm})$ spectral regions using the quasimonochromatic output of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The temperature effect on the photoinduced absorption rise and decay kinetics was studied in the green spectral region.

## EXPERIMENTAL

In our experiments, we used a high-optical-quality $\mathrm{Bi}_{12} \mathrm{TiO}_{20}\langle\mathrm{Ca}$ ) single crystal $5.9 \mathrm{~mm}$ in thickness (along [100]), prepared by top-seeded solution growth as described previously [19]. The (100) faces of the crystal, $12 \times 12 \mathrm{~mm}$ in dimensions, were polished optically. The crystal was fixed in a copper holder and mounted on a heater based on a thermoelectric Peltier element. The programmed temperature controller, built around an ADuC824 microcontroller, allowed the temperature to be maintained with an accuracy of $\pm 0.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The temperature was measured by a DS-1620 digital thermometer and continuously recorded on a computer. At room temperature (about $23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ), the crystal temperature could be stabilized at $5-110^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

In measurements of the temperature-dependent absorption coefficient $\alpha_{0}$ in the dark, the heating rate was $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{min}$. After heating to the set temperature, the sample was held isothermally for $5 \mathrm{~min}$. Next, the sample was illuminated for a short time ( $1-2 \mathrm{~s}$, in order to minimize the photoinduced absorption). The measurements were made using a computer-interfaced system described elsewhere $[15]$.

All experiments were carried out without illumination. Between the experiments, the crystal was stored in the dark for at least $72 \mathrm{~h}$ to allow $\alpha_{0}$ relaxation. As light sources, we used LEDs operating at 660,570 , and $505 \mathrm{~nm}$.

Photoinduced absorption kinetics were studied at $\lambda=525 \mathrm{~nm}$, an incident power density of $3 \mathrm{~mW} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$, and temperatures of 23 and $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. At both tempera-

tures, after pumping for $2400 \mathrm{~s}$ the beam was shut out, and the absorption decay was followed in the dark.

## EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

$505 \mathrm{~nm}$ was found to be $\alpha_{\mathrm{R}_{0}}=0.15 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}, \alpha_{Y_{0}}=$ $0.74 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, and $\alpha_{\mathrm{G}_{0}}=4.06 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, respectively. The temperature dependences of $\Delta \alpha(t)=\alpha_{0}(t)-\alpha_{0}\left(t_{0}\right)$ at 660 and $570 \mathrm{~nm}$ are shown in Fig. 1a, and those at $505 \mathrm{~nm}$ are shown in Fig. 1b. At the three wavelengths, the absorption coefficient increases with temperature. With decreasing $\lambda$, both $\alpha_{0}\left(t_{0}\right)$ and $\Delta \alpha$ grow. The increase in absorption coefficient upon an increase in temperature from 23 to $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(\Delta \alpha_{\mathrm{R}}=0.018 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}, \Delta \alpha_{\mathrm{Y}}=0.24 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\right.$, $\Delta \alpha_{\mathrm{G}}=1.65 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ ) constitutes 12 to $40 \%$ of $\alpha_{0}\left(t_{0}\right)$.

$\mathrm{Bi}_{12} \mathrm{TiO}_{20}\langle\mathrm{Ca}\rangle$ crystals are known to exhibit appreciable photoinduced absorption in the visible range, which was studied earlier at room temperature [19]. Figure 2 illustrates photoinduced absorption kinetics at 23 and $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The absorption is seen to rise more rapidly at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (curve 2 ) compared to $23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (curve 1 ), but the saturation level at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is markedly lower.

At $\tau=3000,4200$, and $6000 \mathrm{~s}$, the sample was pumped for a short time ( $1-2 \mathrm{~s}$ ), and then the absorption

decay was analyzed. At $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, \Delta \alpha$ dropped to zero in less than $1800 \mathrm{~s}$; at $23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, a decrease in $\Delta \alpha$ to about $0.75 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ took $5600 \mathrm{~s}$. The photoinduced absorption rise curves obtained in the first and second $(\tau=8000 \mathrm{~s})$ pump cycles differed very little.

To gain more detailed insight into the photoinduced absorption decay, we carried out seven consecutive $505-\mathrm{nm}$ pump cycles at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (Fig. 3). After each cycle, long enough for the photoinduced absorption to achieve a steady-state level, the storage time in the dark was increased by a factor of 2 . In this way, we obtained the photoinduced absorption decay curve displayed in Fig. 4. The decay curves obtained at 23 and $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ are well represented by exponentials with decay times of 11700 and 149 s, respectively. Analysis of the photoinduced absorption rise curves at short pump times (Figs. 2, 3) indicates a linear rise in absorption. The slope depends on the pump intensity and is $1.5 \times$ $10^{-3} \mathrm{~cm} /(\mathrm{mW} \mathrm{s})$ at $23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Increasing the temperature to $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ slightly increases the slope, to $1.7 \times$ $10^{-3} \mathrm{~cm} /(\mathrm{mW} \mathrm{s})$.

## DISCUSSION

In interpreting our results, we rely on the model described in [15], which assumes the presence of two defect species: a photoactive donor and trapping center. Either species has its own set of energy levels, and electron transitions between donor centers and traps can be caused by photo- or thermal excitation. In this model, an increase in photoinduced absorption is due to the fact that the photoionization cross section of filled traps exceeds that of the donor. The reduction in the dark population of the donor and trap levels with increasing energy separation from the top of the valence band leads to a reduction in absorption with increasing wavelength.

The increase in the absorption coefficient with temperature, observed in the red, yellow, and green spectral regions, may be due to the filling of higher levels via intracenter transitions and to the higher probability of thermally induced electron transitions from donor centers to traps. Long-term illumination gives rise to charge redistribution over the coupled systems of donor centers and traps owing to the electron photoexcitation to the conduction band and subsequent capture by ionized donors and empty traps, influencing the absorption coefficient of the crystal in the visible range. The filling of traps with thermally excited electrons seems to be responsible for the decrease in $\Delta \alpha$ with increasing temperature.

## CONCLUSIONS

The photoinduced absorption in a Ca-doped bismuth titanate crystal was measured as a function of temperature in the red $(660 \mathrm{~nm})$, yellow $(570 \mathrm{~nm})$, and green $(505 \mathrm{~nm})$ spectral regions.

The results demonstrate that, in the range $23-$ $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the absorption coefficient of the crystal rises with decreasing $\lambda$. As the temperature is raised from 23 to $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the absorption coefficient increases by 12 to $40 \%$ of the $23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ value: $\Delta \alpha_{\mathrm{R}}=0.018 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}, \Delta \alpha_{\mathrm{Y}}=$ $0.24 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}, \Delta \alpha_{\mathrm{G}}=1.65 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. After 505-nm illumination, the absorption decay curves at 23 and $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ are well represented by exponentials with decay times of 11700 and $149 \mathrm{~s}$, respectively.
