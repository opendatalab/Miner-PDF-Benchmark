#### Abstract

Two types of metasedimentary rocks occur in the Trans-North China Orogen of the North China Craton. One type consists of highly metamorphosed supracrustal rocks with protoliths of mature cratonic shale, called khondalites, as found in the Lüliang Complex; rocks of the other type are also highly metamorphosed but less mature, as represented by the Wanzi supracrustal assemblage in the Fuping Complex. U-Pb isotopic data for detrital zircons from khondalites show a provenance dominated by 1.9-2.1 Ga Palaeoproterozoic rocks. These detrital zircons display a wide range of $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Hf}}$ values from -16.0 to +9.2 and give $\mathrm{Hf}$ isotopic model ages mostly around $2.3 \mathrm{Ga}$. The high positive $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Hf}}$ values approach those for the depleted mantle at $2.1 \mathrm{Ga}$, highlighting a juvenile crustal growth event in Palaeoproterozoic times. Hf isotopic data also imply that $c .2 .6$ Ga old crustal material was involved in the Palaeoproterozoic magmatic event. These data are similar to those for the khondalitic rocks from the interior of the Western Block of the North China Craton, suggesting a common provenance. In contrast, other metasedimentary rocks in the Trans-North China Orogen, such as the Wanzi supracrustal assemblage in the Fuping Complex, have a source region with both Palaeoproterozoic and Archaean rocks. Their detrital zircon Hf isotopic data indicate reworking of old crustal material and a lack of significant juvenile Palaeoproterozoic magmatic input. These rocks are similar to the coevally deposited meta-sedimentary rocks in the interior of the Eastern Block. We propose that the Lüliang khondalites were deposited on the eastern margin of the Western Block in a passive continental margin environment and were thrust eastward later during collision with the Eastern Block. Other metasedimentary rocks in the Trans-North China Orogen were deposited on the western margin of the Eastern Block in a continental arc environment. Our data support the eastward subduction model for the Palaeoproterozoic tectonic evolution of the North China Craton.


Keywords: detrital zircon, U-Pb age, Hf isotope, khondalites, North China Craton.

## 1. Introduction

The North China Craton is the largest and oldest continental block in China, with rocks up to $3.8 \mathrm{Ga}$ old (Liu et al. 1992; Song et al. 1996). This craton has traditionally been considered to have a relatively uniform Archaean to Palaeoproterozoic basement. However, recent studies have applied terrane accretion and collisional models to the craton ( $\mathrm{Li}$ et al. 1990; Li, Hart \& Wu, 1990; Bai, 1996; Wang et al. 1996; Wu \& Zhong, 1998; Zhao et al. 1998, 1999a, 2000a, $2001 a, b, 2005$; Wilde, Zhao \& Sun, 2002; Kusky \& Li, 2003; Zhai \& Liu, 2003; Kusky, Li \& Santosh, 2007). A Palaeoproterozoic collisional belt, named the TransNorth China Orogen, was recognized. Along this belt, two discrete Archaean to Palaeoproterozoic continental blocks, called the Eastern and Western blocks, were amalgamated to form a coherent basement of the North China Craton at c. 1.85 Ga (Fig. 1; Zhao et al. 1998, 2000b, 2001a, 2005; Wilde et al. 1997, 1998, 2004a, b, 2005; Wilde, Zhao \& Sun, 2002; Guo \& Zhai, 2001; Guo, O'Brien \& Zhai, 2002; Guo et al. 2005; Kröner et al. 2005a, b, 2006; Faure et al. 2007; Trap et al. 2007). There is now a clear outline of the timing

However, the crustal evolution history of this craton before amalgamation remains poorly understood.

Palaeoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks of different metamorphic grades, which preserve the history of the exposed continental crust at the time of their deposition, are widely distributed in the North China Craton, including the Liaohe, Laoling, Ji'an, Jingshan and Fenzishan groups in the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt within the Eastern Block and Jining, DaqingshanWulashan, Helanshan-Qianlishan complexes within the Khondalite Belt in the Western Block (Fig. 1). In the Trans-North China Orogen, metasedimentary rocks are exposed in the Shangtaihua, Hutuo groups and the Fuping, Lüliang complexes (Fig. 1). Previous U-Pb studies on detrital zircons have shown that all these rocks within the three discrete mobile belts experienced the late Palaeoproterozoic metamorphism (Luo et al. 2004, 2008; Lu et al. 2006; Xia et al. 2006a, b, c; Wan et al. 2006a,b), but there are some important differences.

Firstly, the metamorphic overgrowth zircon rims or zircons with metamorphic origin in the Khondalite Belt



Figure 1. Tectonic subdivision of the North China Craton and spatial distribution of the Palaeoproterozoic supracrustal rocks (after Zhao et al. 2005). CD - Chengde; ZH - Zhahuang.

and the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt yield some ages at about $1.92 \mathrm{Ga}$ and $1.93 \mathrm{Ga}$, respectively (Luo et al. 2004, 2008; Lu et al. 2006; Wan et al. 2006a; Santosh, Wilde \& Li, 2007), while $1.88-1.82$ Ga metamorphic ages are recorded in the Trans-North China Orogen (Wan et al. 2006a,b). This suggests that the continental collision between the Western and Eastern blocks might have happened slightly later than the collision between the Yinshan and Ordos terranes along the Khondalite Belt, as well as the closure of the rift along the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt. The second difference is the ages of rocks in their source region. Both Archaean (c. 2.5 Ga) and Palaeoproterozoic rocks are abundant in the metasedimentary source rocks from the Jiao-LiaoJi Belt of the Eastern Block (Luo et al. 2004, 2008; Wan et al. 2006b) and the Shangtaihua, Hutuo groups and the Fuping Complex in the Trans-North China Orogen (Xia et al. 2006b; Wan et al. 2006a,b), while Palaeoproterozoic rocks dominate the source region for those metasedimentary rocks from the Khondalite Belt of the Western Block (Xia et al. 2006a,c; Wan et al. 2006b).

The Lüliang Complex is located in the central segment of the Trans-North China Orogen (Fig. 1). Of particular significance is that some metasedimentary rocks in this complex are similar to those from the Khondalite Belt, not those from the Trans-North China Orogen. Therefore, the Lüliang Complex is considered to have been thrust from the west and subsequently incorporated into the Trans-North China Orogen during the collision between the Eastern and Western blocks. However, they have not been investigated, especially in terms of detrital zircon $\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ ages and $\mathrm{Hf}$ isotope compositions. In this study, we carried out an integrated study of $\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ and $\mathrm{Hf}$ isotope on the detrital zircons separated from the Lüliang khondalites to test this idea. Our results provide important constraints not only on their provenance, but also on controversial and ambiguous issues regarding the tectonic evolution of the North China Craton.

## 2. Geological background

The Lüliang Complex in the Trans-North China Orogen is located in an area adjacent to the eastern margin of the Western Block (Fig. 1) and mainly consists of metasedimentary rocks intruded by granitoid plutons (Geng et al. 2000; Wan et al. 2000b; Zhao et al. 2008). The metasedimentary rocks of the complex have been divided into the Jiehekou, Lüliang and Yejishan/Heichashan groups (Fig. 2; Yu, Wang \& Wang, 1997; Geng et al. 2000; Wan et al. 2000b). The metasedimentary rocks from the Jiehekou Group share common lithological, mineralogical and geochemical features with those of the Khondalite Belt and are referred to as khondalites in the Chinese literature (Qian \& Li, 1999; Li, Qian \& Liu, 2000; Wan et al. $2000 a, b)$. These rocks are composed of subequal amounts of quartz, plagioclase, $\mathrm{K}$-feldspar and garnet. Biotite and sillimanite are important in most samples.

Trace minerals include zircon, apatite, iron oxides and sphene. They are characterized by large ion lithophile elements (LILE) enrichment, and lower abundances of $\mathrm{Zr}$, Hf and Sr. Their rare earth element (REE) distribution has significant LREE enrichment and a negative Eu anomaly. They are mainly exposed in the northwestern part of the complex (Fig. 2) and the major rock types are amphibolite- to granulitefacies graphite-bearing pelitic gneiss/schist, quartzite, felsic paragneiss, marble, calc-silicate rock and minor amphibolite/granulite. Single khondalite layers commonly range in thickness from tens to hundreds of metres. These khondalites show multiple phases of deformation, and commonly occur as strongly foliated, transposed and folded tectonic slices in the field, as manifested by repeated lithological sequences (Li, Qian \& Liu, 2000). Locally, a gradational sequence consisting of fine-grained paragneiss, schist and gneiss can be observed (Li, Qian \& Liu, 2000). In some locations, leucocratic bands and minor garnet-bearing granitic bodies are present in the khondalites, which were avoided in the field sampling.

The Lüliang Group crops out only in the Jinzhouyu area (Fig. 2) and is made up of predominantly basalt, andesite, dacite, rhyolite, wacke, sandstone, banded iron formation and argillaceous rocks metamorphosed in greenschist facies. Coarse-grained amphibolites with preserved gabbroic texture and fine-grained metabasite derived from basalt or diabase crop out as lenses intercalated within sandstone. The metre size of the mafic blocks and their scattering in the terrigeneous rocks suggest that they might be olistoliths (Faure et al. 2007). This group is considered to have formed in a magmatic arc and/or a back-arc basin environment (Faure et al. 2007; Trap et al. 2007). Regionally, the Lüliang Group is not in direct contact with the Jiehekou Group (Fig. 2), but both groups are tectonically overlain by the Yejishan/Heichashan Group, which occurs along a narrow, NE-SW-trending belt that extends from Dongmafang, through Yejishan and Heichashan, to Fangshan (Fig. 2). The Yejishan/Heichashan Group consists of sub-greenschist-facies metamorphosed conglomerates, quartz wackes, sandstones and minor limestones, lithologically and metamorphically similar to the Hutuo Group that overlies the Wutai Group in the Wutai area (Fig. 1). Widespread mafic volcanic rocks in this group were dated by the zircon $\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ method at $2124 \pm 38 \mathrm{Ma}$ (Geng et al. 2000).

A foreland basin has been proposed as the formation environment for this group (Bai, Wang \& Guo, 1992; Wu \& Zhong, 1998; Wilde et al. 2004b; Zhang et al. 2006a).

## 3. Analytical procedures

The samples were crushed and subsequently separated by a heavy liquid and magnetic method. Zircons were hand picked and mounted on an adhesive tape, enclosed in epoxy resin and then polished to about half their size. Cathodo-luminescence (CL) imaging of zircon grains was taken in order to observe the inner structure and choose potential target sites for $\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ dating and $\mathrm{Hf}$ analyses at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, using a CAMECA SE-50 microprobe.

## 3.a. U-Pb dating

A VG PQ Excel ICP-MS machine equipped with a New Wave Research LUV213 laser ablation system, at the University of Hong Kong, was utilized to analyse the $\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ isotope compositions of zircons. The laser system delivers a beam of $213 \mathrm{~nm}$ UV light from a frequency-quintupled Nd:YAG laser. Analytical settings include a beam diameter of $\sim 40 \mu \mathrm{m}, 10 \mathrm{~Hz}$ repetition rate, and energy of $0.6-1.3 \mathrm{~mJ}$ per pulse. This gave a ${ }^{238} \mathrm{U}$ signal of $3 \times 10^{4}$ to $100 \times 10^{4}$ counts, depending on $U$ contents. A typical ablation time was 30-60 s, resulting in pits $20-40 \mu \mathrm{m}$ deep. Helium carrier gas was used to transport the ablated sample materials from the laser-ablation cell to the ICPMS torch after mixing with argon gas. No common lead correction has been made because the common lead concentration is generally below the detection limit of the ICP-MS. More detailed instrumental settings and analytical procedures have been described by Xia $e t$ al. (2004).

## 3.b. Hf isotope analyses

Hf isotope analyses were conducted by a Neptune multi-collector (MC) ICPMS coupled with an ArF excimer laser ablation system at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. Ablated material in the laser-ablation cell was transported to the ICPMS torch by helium carrier gas. Analytical settings include a beam diameter of $\sim 63 \mu \mathrm{m}, 10 \mathrm{~Hz}$ repetition rate, and energies density of $15 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$, which yielded a signal intensity of $\sim 10 \mathrm{~V}$ at ${ }^{180} \mathrm{Hf}$ for the standard zircon 91500 in situ analysis. During analysis, raw count rates for ${ }^{172} \mathrm{Yb}$, ${ }^{173} \mathrm{Yb},{ }^{175} \mathrm{Lu},{ }^{176}(\mathrm{Hf}+\mathrm{Yb}+\mathrm{Lu}),{ }^{177} \mathrm{Hf},{ }^{178} \mathrm{Hf},{ }^{179} \mathrm{Hf}$, ${ }^{180} \mathrm{Hf}$ and ${ }^{182} \mathrm{~W}$ were collected. Interference of ${ }^{176} \mathrm{Lu}$ on ${ }^{176} \mathrm{Hf}$ was corrected by measuring the intensity of the interference-free ${ }^{175} \mathrm{Lu}$ isotope and using the recommended ${ }^{176} \mathrm{Lu} /{ }^{175} \mathrm{Lu}$ ratio of 0.02655 (Chu et al. 2002). The ${ }^{176} \mathrm{Yb} /{ }^{172} \mathrm{Yb}$ value of 0.5887 and mean $\beta_{\mathrm{Yb}}$ value obtained during $\mathrm{Hf}$ analysis on the same spot were applied for the interference correction of ${ }^{176} \mathrm{Yb}$ on ${ }^{176} \mathrm{Hf}$. The sites of spot $\mathrm{Hf}$ analysis are adjacent to those of $\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ analysis within the same cathodoluminescence domain of zircons. More detailed instrumental settings and analytical procedures have been described by $\mathrm{Xu}$ et al. (2004).

## 4. Results

## 4.a. CL images of zircons

The CL images show that most detrital zircons from the Lüliang khondalites have concentric oscillatory zoning (Fig. 3b-e, h, i), indicating their igneous origin. A minor portion of zircons have discernable cores mantled by an oscillatory zoning rim (Fig. 3a, f, g, j), which are interpreted to be inherited from the source of the precursor magma.

## 4.b. $\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ and $\mathrm{Hf}$ isotopic results

A total of $189 \mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ and $146 \mathrm{Hf}$ isotope analyses have been conducted for the three samples in this study. The analytical data are presented in Table 1 and Appendix Table A1, the latter available as supplementary material online at http://journals.cambridge.org/geo.

## 4.b.1. Sample LL006

This sample is a meta-quartzose sandstone, collected from $200 \mathrm{~m}$ west of Dongnan Village, about $40 \mathrm{~km}$ south of Xingxian (N38 09.033'; E111 ${ }^{\circ} 18.517^{\prime}$; Fig. 2). The sample consists of more than $90 \%$ quartz and minor flint and silicic lithic fragments. Most detrital zircons from the sample are euhedral or subeuhedral and have concentric oscillatory zoning (Fig. 3b, c), with $\mathrm{Th} / \mathrm{U}$ ratios ranging from 0.26 to 6.93, typical of an igneous origin. Some zircon grains have concentric oscillatory zoned cores, which can be recognized by discordant zoning from the major parts of the zircons (Fig. 3a). Zircon U-Pb isotopic results are presented in online Appendix Table A1 at http://journals.cambridge.org/geo and in a concordia diagram (Fig. 4a). Most of the 58 analyses are discordant, with a wide range of ${ }^{207} \mathrm{~Pb}-{ }^{206} \mathrm{~Pb}$ ages between 1.9 and $2.6 \mathrm{Ga}$. Three age populations are defined at $2.0 \mathrm{Ga}, 2.2 \mathrm{Ga}$ and $2.4 \mathrm{Ga}$ by concordant or nearly concordant data on the concordia diagram. A number of age peaks mainly at $1976,2100,2182,2288$, 2400 and $2544 \mathrm{Ma}$ appear on the histogram based on ${ }^{207} \mathrm{~Pb}-{ }^{206} \mathrm{~Pb}$ age data with discordance between $-20 \%$ and $20 \%$ (Fig 4a, inset). These zircons have $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Hf}}$ values from -11.1 to +8.2 with a peak at +5 (Fig. 5a), suggesting that while old crust was involved in the magmatism, a juvenile source was very significant. The $\mathrm{Hf}$ model ages $\left(\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{DM}}^{\mathrm{C}}\right.$ ) range from 2.17 to $3.14 \mathrm{Ga}$ with a dominant peak at 2.4-2.6 Ga on the histogram (Fig. 5d).

## 4.b.2. Sample LL008

This sample is a sillimanite-bearing biotite gneiss collected from west of Hejiawan Village, about $50 \mathrm{~km}$ west of Loufan (N38 09.493'; E111 16.619'; Fig. 2). The sample contains $25-40 \%$ plagioclase, $25-30 \%$ quartz, $15-20 \%$ biotite and $2-10 \%$ garnet and sillimanite. Biotite defines a marked foliation, and sillimanite generally occurs in foliation planes. Most detrital zircons from the sample are euhedral or subeuhedral and have obviously concentric oscillatory zoning (Fig. 3d, e). Their Th/U ratios range from 0.1 to 2.1, indicating an igneous origin. Some zircon grains have distinct luminescent cores (Fig. 3f, g) with ${ }^{207} \mathrm{~Pb}-206 \mathrm{~Pb}$ ages differing from their oscillatorily zoned mantles (LL008-46 and LL008-47, online Appendix Table A1), suggesting the core is inherited in origin.

Three highly disconcordant analytical results, out of a total of 78, for inherited cores give ${ }^{207} \mathrm{~Pb}^{206} \mathrm{~Pb}$ ages up to $3.4 \mathrm{Ga}$ (Fig. 4b). The other 75 analyses mostly give concordant or nearly concordant ages between 2000 and $2600 \mathrm{Ma}$. The ${ }^{207} \mathrm{~Pb}-206 \mathrm{~Pb}$ age histogram for nearly concordant data (with discordance between $-20 \%$ and $20 \%$; Fig. 4b, inset) has multiple age peaks from 2030 to 2300 Ma. Hf isotope analyses for these zircons yield $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Hf}}$ values from -16.0 to +9.2 (Fig. $5 \mathrm{~b}$ ), suggesting derivation of their precursor magmas from both old crust and juvenile materials. The $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{DM}}{ }^{\mathrm{C}}$ model ages are quite diverse, ranging from 2.18 to $3.90 \mathrm{Ga}$ and showing a bimodal distribution on the histogram, with peaks at 2.29 and $2.61 \mathrm{Ga}$ (Fig. 5e).

## 4.b.3. Sample LL009

This sample is a metamorphosed pebble-bearing quartzose sandstone, collected from the Yangpo Reservoir in Donghui Village, about $40 \mathrm{~km}$ south of Xingxian (N38 ${ }^{\circ} 10.453^{\prime}$; E111 12.225'; Fig. 2). Granular quartziferous or granitic pebbles are usually $4-10 \mathrm{~mm}$ in size, and more than $90 \%$ of the composition of this sample is quartz. Similar to those in the above two samples, zircons from this sample are mostly subhedral to euhedral, with concentric oscillatory zoning (Fig. 3h, i), and $\mathrm{Th} / \mathrm{U}$ ratios range from 0.20 to 2.49 , indicating an igneous provenance. Some zircon grains have concentric oscillatory zoned cores, which can be recognized by discordant zoning with the major parts of zircons (Fig. 3j), which are interpreted as inherited or xenocrystic cores.

Forty-seven out of $54 \mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ analyses define a good discordant line with an upper intercept age of $2066 \pm 10 \mathrm{Ma}$ (MSWD =6.0, Fig. 4c, open ellipse). These zircons yield a range of ${ }^{207} \mathrm{~Pb}-{ }^{206} \mathrm{~Pb}$ ages between 1943 and $2140 \mathrm{Ma}$. The other seven analytical results (Fig. 4c, solid ellipse) show varied degrees of discordance and give ages from 2180 to $2512 \mathrm{Ma}$. On the histogram for ${ }^{207} \mathrm{~Pb}-{ }^{206} \mathrm{~Pb}$ age data with discordance between $-20 \%$ and $20 \%$, a dominating sharp peak appears at $2075 \mathrm{Ma}$ (almost the same as the intercept age) (Fig. 4c, inset). The Hf-isotope analyses give $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Hf}}$ values ranging from +0.24 to +7.69 , mostly at +5 (Fig. 5c), showing that their source was mainly juvenile. The $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{DM}}^{\mathrm{C}}$ model ages range from 2.15 to $2.63 \mathrm{Ga}$ with a single sharp peak at $2.31 \mathrm{Ga}$ (Fig. 5 f).

## 5. Discussion

## 5.a. Age of source rocks and crustal evolution history in the source area

The detrital zircons from the Lüliang khondalites have ${ }^{207} \mathrm{~Pb}-{ }^{206} \mathrm{~Pb}$ ages ranging from $1.9 \mathrm{Ga}$ to $2.3 \mathrm{Ga}$, mostly at $2.0 \mathrm{Ga}$ (Fig. 4), indicating that Palaeoproterozoic rocks were dominant in the source region. Minor portions of concordant or nearly concordant Archaean

ages are also obtained, and one highly discordant data point gives a suspicious ${ }^{207} \mathrm{~Pb}-206 \mathrm{~Pb}$ age up to $3.4 \mathrm{Ga}$. However, these ages are mainly obtained from the xenocrystic or inherited cores.

The composite plot of $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Hf}}$ values versus ${ }^{207} \mathrm{~Pb}-{ }^{206} \mathrm{~Pb}$ ages for all the analysed zircons (including detrital zircon and their inherited cores) shows that positive $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Hf}}$ values are dominant for the detrital zircons from the Lüliang khondalites and the maximum $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Hf}}$ values occur for some $c$. 2.1-2.2 Ga zircons, which plot on or near to the depleted mantle evolutionary line (Fig. 6). Thereafter, the highest $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Hf}}$ values decrease
with age, corresponding to a ${ }^{176} \mathrm{Lu} /{ }^{177} \mathrm{Hf}$ ratio of 0.007 , almost equal to that of the upper continent $(0.008$; Taylor \& McLennan, 1985; Fig. 6). This means that a large volume of magmas from a juvenile source were incorporated into the crust during Palaeoproterozoic times at 2.1 to $2.2 \mathrm{Ga}$. About $95 \%$ of Hf isotopic data plot above the $c$. $2.6 \mathrm{Ga}$ crust reference line (Fig. 6), suggesting that there was a 2.6 Ga pre-existing lower crust underlying their source region.

## 5.b. Constraints on the sedimentary provenance of the Lüliang khondalites

Due to their high mechanical and chemical resistance, accessory minerals such as zircons have been used extensively as markers of provenance in sediments and (meta-) sedimentary rocks (Bodet \& Scharer, 2000; Condie et al. 2005; Veevers et al. 2005). The early zircon $\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ studies of sediment provenance involved conventional $\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ analyses of bulk zircon samples which gave only the average age of a number of grains. This restricted their application to areas where all grains were believed to have a single provenance, or to zircon populations which could be subdivided based on their morphology (e.g. Gaudette, Vitrac-Michard \& Allègre, 1981). Recent studies have adopted spot analyses on zircon to avoid mixing of different generations for a single grain, by use of sensitive high-resolution ion micro-probe (SHRIMP) or LA-ICPMS (e.g. Wan et al. $2006 a, b$ and Xia $e t$ al. $2006 a, c$ ), thus the population assemblages of more complex sedimentary systems can be assessed. Besides $\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ ages, the $\mathrm{Lu}-\mathrm{Hf}$ isotope systematics of zircons provide additional insights into the geological history of their provenance, since they provide crust formation ages for the igneous source rocks. Recent studies show that combined $\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ ages and $\mathrm{Hf}$ isotopic data from detrital zircons can elucidate the source of sediments more precisely (e.g. Veevers et al. 2005).

Detrital zircons analysed in this study for the Lüliang khondalites have ${ }^{207} \mathrm{~Pb}-206 \mathrm{~Pb}$ ages ranging from $1.9 \mathrm{Ga}$ to $2.3 \mathrm{Ga}$, mostly at $2.0 \mathrm{Ga}$. This age pattern is much different from that of the Eastern Block and the other sedimentary rocks of the Trans-North China Orogen. The Eastern Block is known to have basements ranging from the early Archaean (up to $c$. 3.8 Ga: Liu et al. 1992; Song et al. 1996), through middle Archaean (3.4-2.9 Ga: e.g. Jahn et al. 1987; Song et al. 1996) to late Archaean (2.9-2.5 Ga: e.g. Wu et al. 1991; Kröner et al. 1998). Late Archaean rocks are dominant in these areas (see review by Zhao et al. 2005 and references therein), but there are very few Archaean zircons in the Lüliang khondalites. Hf isotopic data also do not favour Archaean rocks as an important component in the source region. Most of the zircons from the Lüliang khondalites have Hf model ages from 2.2 to $2.6 \mathrm{Ga}$ with peaks at 2.3, 2.4 and 2.6 Ga for different samples (Fig. 5d-f). This is in contrast with available Hf isotopic data for detrital zircons from other metasedimentary rocks in the Trans-North China Orogen and Eastern Block, which recorded a Hf model ages peak at 2.62.8 Ga and a minor peak at 2.8-3.0 Ga (Xia et al. $2006 b$; Luo et al. 2008; see also below).

In the Western Block, rocks from the Yinshan Terrane are also dominated by 2.5-2.6 Ga high-grade tonalitic-trondhjemitic-granodioritic (TTG) gneiss (Wang, 1993), but the age of the Ordos basement rocks remains unknown due to the coverage of Mesozoic to Cenozoic sedimentary rocks. Previous detrital zircon $\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ age data for the khondalitic rocks along its northern margin indicate a quite similar age pattern with that for the Lüliang khondalites (Xia et al. $2006 a, c$ ). Additionally, the Hf isotopic data show that these khondalitic rocks (both in the Khondalite Belt and in the Lüliang Complex) share a common crustal evolution history in their provenance: the crustal material was largely separated from the mantle c. $2.6 \mathrm{Ga}$ ago, and significant addition of juvenile material occurred at about 2.1 Ga in their source region (data in this study and Xia et al. 2006c, 2008). In summary, our detrital zircon $\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ and $\mathrm{Hf}$ isotopic data presented in this paper may suggest that the Lüliang khondalites share a common provenance with those khondalitic rocks in the Western Block. Hence our data are consistent with previous considerations that the Lüliang khondalites were deposited on a stable continental margin of the Ordos Terrane (Condie et al. 1992; Zhao et al. 2005; Xia et al. 2006a,c) and were thrust from the west and subsequently incorporated into the Trans-North China Orogen during the collision between the Eastern and Western blocks (Zhao et al. 2008).

In addition, it is worth noting that the age pattern of the Lüliang khondalites contained in the Jiehekou Group is also in strong contrast to that for the Palaeoproterozoic supracrustal rocks in the Lüliang and Yejishan/Hechashan groups, which show two main age peaks of 2.5 and $2.1 \mathrm{Ga}$ (Liu \& Zhao, 2008). This means that the Lüliang Complex cannot be a sedimentary succession and that the subdivision into 'groups' is inappropriate. These supracrustal rocks in the Lüliang Complex are different in metamorphic grade, sedimentary environment and detrital source. They were juxtaposed together by subsequent tectonic disturbance.

## 5.c. U-Pb and Hf model age frameworks of the khondalites source and its comparison with that of the Eastern Block and the Trans-North China Orogen

A total of 636 detrital zircon ${ }^{207} \mathrm{~Pb}-206 \mathrm{~Pb}$ ages for the khondalites from present and previous studies (Wan et al. 2006a; Xia et al. 2006a,c) are plotted in Figure 7a. It displays a quasi-unimodal distribution with a peak at 1.9-2.0 Ga. We consider that this age pattern reflects, to some extent, a very important tectonothermal event which occurred during the period 1.9-2.0 Ga in their source region. This age pattern is in strong contrast to that of other Palaeoproterozoic

Histograms for the distribution of detrital zircon ${ }^{207} \mathrm{~Pb}$ ${ }^{206} \mathrm{~Pb}$ ages from Palaeoproterozoic meta-sedimentary rocks in (a) Western Block (data sources: Wan et al. 2006a; Xia et al. 2006a, $c$ and this study); (b) Trans-North China Orogen (data sources: Guan et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2002b; Wilde et al. 2004b; Wan et al. 2006a,b and Xia et al. 2006b); (c) Eastern Block of the North China Craton (data sources: Luo et al. 2004, 2008 and Wan et al. 2006a).

metasedimentary rocks of the Trans-North China Orogen (Fig. 7b) and Eastern Block (Fig. 7c), which is characterized by two zircon age peaks at 2.1 and $2.5 \mathrm{Ga}$, corresponding to their voluminous $\mathrm{Ar}$ chaean tonalitic-trondhjemitic-granodioritic gneisses and Palaeoproterozoic granite $(\mathrm{n}=289$ and 530, respectively; data sources: Guan et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2002b; Luo et al. 2004, 2008; Wilde et al. 2004b; Wan et al. 2006a, b; Xia et al. 2006b). The khondalite source region also shows a quasi-unimodal distribution in the detrital zircon $\mathrm{Hf}$ model ages $\left(\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{DM}}^{\mathrm{C}}\right.$ ), peaking at

Data sources: Luo et al. (2008); Xia et al. (2006b,c) and this study.

c. $2.3 \mathrm{Ga}$. We interpret this peak age as the mean crustal residence age of the crustal materials extracted from the depleted mantle in the khondalite source region. This is also in strong contrast with that for other rocks of the Trans-North China Orogen and the Eastern Block, that is, the former displays a unimodal distribution in detrital zircon Hf model ages $\left(\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{DM}}^{\mathrm{C}}\right.$ ) with a peak at c. $2.6 \mathrm{Ga}$ (Fig. 8b) and the latter shows a major peak at c. 2.6-2.8 Ga (Fig. 8c).

## 5.d. Tectonic implications

Recent studies have led to a general consensus that the North China Craton formed by the collision between the Eastern and Western blocks along the Trans-North

China Orogen. However, uncertainties remain. The first issue regards timing of the amalgamation of the two blocks, with some researchers arguing that the final collision between the Western and Eastern blocks was at c. $2.5 \mathrm{Ga}$ (Wang et al. 1996; Li et al. 2000; Li \& Kusky, 2007; Zhai, Bian \& Zhao, 2000; Kusky \& Li, 2003; Polat et al. 2005, 2006), whereas others believe the collision occurred at $c .1 .85 \mathrm{Ga}$ (Wilde et al. 1997, 1998, 2004a, $b$, 2005; Wilde, Zhao \& Sun, 2002; Guo et al. 2005; Guan et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 1999a, $2000 a, b, 2002 b, 2005,2008$; Kröner et al. 2005a, b, 2006; Liu et al. 2006). The latter interpretation has received wide support from recently published geochronological data for metamorphic zircons from various lithologies of the Trans-North China Orogen, including high-pressure granulites and amphibolites, charnockites and reworked gneisses (Wilde et al. 1998, 2004b; Guo, Zhai \& Xu, 2001; Guo et al. 2001, 2005; Guo \& Zhai, 2001; Guan et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2002b; Kröner et al. 2005a,b, 2006; Wan et al. 2006a,b). The Lüliang khondalites experienced medium- to highgrade metamorphism with a clockwise $P-T-t$ path (Zhao et al. 2000a), indicating their deposition before the continental collision. The Palaeoproterozoic detrital zircon ages presented in this study do not support the c. $2.5 \mathrm{Ga}$ collision model, but may provide further evidence for the $c .1 .85 \mathrm{Ga}$ collision.

The second debated issue is the direction of the subduction. Some researchers suggested a westward subduction along the east margin of the Western Block (Kusky \& Li, 2003; Polat et al. 2005, 2006; Faure et al. 2007; Trap et al. 2007), whereas other researchers proposed that the subduction was eastward along the western margin of the Eastern Block (Zhao et al. 1998, 1999b, 2000b, 2005, Kröner et al. 2005a, b, 2006; Liu et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2007). In both models, the Trans-North China Orogen represents a late Archaean to Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc, which is characterized by dominant Neoarchaean to Palaeoproterozoic arc-related juvenile crust with minor reworked basement rocks, fragments of ancient oceanic crust, mélanges, high-pressure granulites, retrograded eclogites, crustal-scale ductile shear zones, and linear fold belts with sheath folds ( $\mathrm{Li}$ et al. 1990; Li, Hart \& Wu, 1990; Zhai, Guo \& Yan, 1992; Wang et al. 1996, 2003, 2004, 2007; Wu \& Zhong, 1998; Zhao, Cawood \& Lu, 1999, Zhao et al. 2000b; Guo, O'Brien \& Zhai, 2002; Zhang et al. 2006b). As mentioned above, detrital zircons from other rocks of the Trans-North China Orogen, such as those from the Wanzi supracrustal rocks of the Fuping Complex (Guan et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2002b; Xia et al. 2006b), the Shangtaihua Group in the Taihua Complex (Wan et al. 2006a,b) and the Hutuo Group in the Wutai Complex (Wilde et al. 2004b; Zhang et al. 2006a), share common characteristics. Their $\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ zircon ages show bimodal distribution at 2.1 and $2.5 \mathrm{Ga}$ and their zircon Hf model ages have a dominant peak at 2.6-2.8 Ga. The coevally deposited meta-sedimentary rocks in the interior areas of the Eastern Block, such as the Liaohe Group in the Liaoning Province (Luo et al. 2004, 2008; Wan et al. 2006a) and the Jingshan and Fenzishan groups in the Shandong Province (Wan et al. 2006a), have similar U- $\mathrm{Pb}$ and $\mathrm{Hf}$ model ages. These characters are in contrast with those for the khondalites source region. If the hypothesis that the khondalites were derived from the Ordos Terrane stands, our results preclude the possibility that the Trans-North China Orogen represents an active continental margin system on the eastern margin of the Western Block, and hence the eastward subduction model is favoured. In this model, the Lüliang khondalites were deposited on the eastern margin of the Western Block in a passive continental margin environment and were thrust eastward later during collision with the Eastern Block. Other metasedimentary rocks in the TransNorth China Orogen, such as the Wanzi Supracrustal rocks, were deposited on the western margin of the Eastern Block in a back-arc basin (Fig. 9). If the hypothesis does not stand, it requires an unknown exotic source area between the Western Block and the TransNorth China Orogen. This scenario does not support the westward subduction model either. Other evidence for the affinity of the Trans-North China Orogen to the Eastern Block includes the fact that large numbers of 2.7-2.8 Ga inherited or xenocrystic zircon ages are found in $c .2 .5 \mathrm{Ga}$ augen gneiss, granitic gneiss and tonalitic-trondhjemitic-granodioritic gneisses located in the Trans-North China Orogen (Guan et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2002b). These data are similar to those from rocks in the Eastern Block, but rare in the khondalite rocks from both the Lüliang Complex and the Khondalite Belt. Nd isotope data for the $c .2 .1 \mathrm{Ga}$ Nanying granitic gneiss in the Trans-North China Orogen show that it represents reworked 2.7-2.8 Ga old crustal material, and also suggest that the Trans-North China Orogen has an affinity to the Eastern Block (H. Guan, unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. Hong Kong, 2000; Liu et al. 2002) because Palaeoproterozoic magmatic activities in the Western Block are characterized by juvenile crustal addition. This scenario is also consistent with the geochemical characters of the khondalites and other supracrustal rocks in the TransNorth China Orogen. The former have chemical index of alteration (CIA) values comparable with that of postArchaean average Australian shale (PAAS), while the chemical index of alteration (CIA) values for the Wanzi Supracrustal rocks are not as high as shale, indicating a significant amount of immature sediments, possibly volcanic-sedimentary rocks (H. Guan, unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. Hong Kong, 2000).

We know that the early crust of the Earth formed by vertical melt segregation, and then lateral accretion of juvenile material along cratonic margins became more important (through accretion of fragments of ocean floor, volcanic arc sequences, and intrusion of tonalitictrondhjemitic-granodioritic-type granite, etc.). In this regard, the Palaeoproterozoic juvenile crustal growth in the khondalites source area may suggest an active continental margin along the Western Block.

However, geochemical characters of the khondalites have well established its cratonic or passive margin type deposition environment (Condie et al. 1992; Li, Qian \& Liu, 2000; Wan et al. 2000a,b). Recent studies on the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) have shown that intraplate magmatism involving plume melting, basalt underplating and differentiation or remelting of a basaltic source is an important process of continental growth even in the Phanerozoic (e.g. Jahn, Wu \& Hong, 2000). Hence we propose that the protoliths of the khondalites were generated by intraplate magmatism.

## 6. Conclusions

$\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Pb}$ and $\mathrm{Hf}$ isotopic data for detrital zircons show that the Lüliang khondalites mainly came from a 1.9-2.1 Ga Palaeoproterozoic source area, similar to that of the khondalite rocks within the Western Block. The Hf isotope data suggest significant crustal growth in Palaeoproterozoic times and the involvement of $c .2 .6 \mathrm{Ga}$ lower crust in the Palaeoproterozoic magmatic activity. These and previously published data for the khondalites are in contrast with other coevally deposited and locally derived supracrustal rocks in the Trans-North China Orogen, precluding the possibility that the Trans-North China Orogen developed on the eastern margin of the Western Block. Instead, coeval detrital zircons in the Trans-North China Orogen and the Eastern Block share many common characteristics, suggesting that they came from a source area with both Palaeoproterozoic and Archaean rocks. These results demonstrate that the Trans-North China Orogen represents a continental margin developed at the western margin of the Eastern Block, thus supporting the eastward subduction model for the Palaeoproterozoic tectonic evolution of the North China Craton.
