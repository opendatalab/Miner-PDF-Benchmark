# Sorghum Phytochemicals and Their Potential Impact on Human Health 

## Linda Dykes


#### Abstract

Sorghum contains a wide array of phytochemicals and their levels are affected by the genotype. Phytochemicals identified in sorghum include phenolic acids, flavonoids, condensed tannins, polycosanols, phytosterols, stilbenes, and phenolamides. Most of these phytochemicals are concentrated in the bran fraction and have been shown to have several potential health benefits, which include antidiabetic, cholesterol-lowering, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. This chapter gives an overview of sorghum genetics relevant to phytochemicals, phytochemicals identified in sorghum grain, and their potential health benefits.

## 1 Introduction

Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is the fifth major cereal in the world after wheat, maize, rice, and barley [1]. It originated in Africa and it is mainly grown in semiarid to arid regions [2]. Sorghum is primarily used as food in Africa and Asia and as feed in Western countries. However, due to its gluten-free characteristics, sorghum is increasingly used as food in gluten-free markets in the United States. Sorghum is processed into several food products and beverage such as bread, tortillas, porridges, couscous, snack foods (e.g., popped, puffed), and beer [3]. All sorghums contain a wide variety of phytochemicals and their compositions are affected by the genotype [4]. These phytochemicals are concentrated in the bran fraction and they are reported to have several potential health benefits, which include antidiabetic, cholesterol-lowering, antiinflammatory, and anticancer properties [4-7]. This chapter gives an overview of sorghum genetics relevant to phytochemicals, phytochemicals identified in sorghum grain, and their potential health benefits.

## 2 Overview of Sorghum Genetics Relevant to Phenolics and Tannins

Sorghum pericarp color is controlled by the $R$ and $\Upsilon$ genes (Fig. 1) $[4,9]$. A pericarp is white when $\Upsilon$ is homozygous recessive ( $r$ ryy or $\left.R \_y y\right)$, whereas a yellow (or lemon-yellow) pericarp has recessive $R$ and dominant $\Upsilon$ genes $\left(r r \Upsilon_{-}\right)$. When both $R$ and $\Upsilon$ genes are dominant, the pericarp is red. The "red" color varies and includes orange, light red, bright red, light brown, dark brown, and black. Black sorghum is a special red sorghum with both dominant $R$ and $\Upsilon$ genes that turns black when grown in the presence of sunlight (Fig. 2) [10]. The intensifier gene $I$ affects the intensity of the pericarp color and is clearly visible in red sorghums $[4,9]$. Red sorghums with the intensifier gene appear bright red compared to those without the gene [9].

Secondary plant color is controlled by the $P$ and $Q$ genes, which is also associated with glume color [9]. Plants with $P_{-} Q$ and $P_{-} q q$ genes produce purple- and red-pigmented plants, respectively, while recessive $p p q q$ genes produce tan-pigmented plants. Secondary plant color can affect the appearance of the grain. Sorghums with the $P_{-} Q$ and $P_{-} q q$ genes have purple/red stains that are leached from the purple/red glumes onto the pericarp when grown under humid conditions or when rainfall occurs [9].

The presence or absence of a pigmented testa (Fig. 3) is controlled by the $B_{I_{-}} B_{2-}$ genes and sorghums with a pigmented testa must have both dominant genes $\left(B_{1_{-}} B_{2-}\right)$ [9]. Sorghums with the $B_{I_{-}} B_{2}$ genes have condensed tannins, which contribute to their astringency and some resistance to molds and deterioration of the grain [11]. These genotypes are also referred to as "bird proof" or "bird resistant" since they provide some resistance to bird predation in the field [4]. When given a choice, birds prefer non-tannin sorghums but they do consume tannin sorghums when no other food is available [4]. In sorghum nurseries with non-tannin white, non-tannin red, and tannin sorghums (both Types II and III), birds were found to eat sorghum in the following order: (1) non-tannin

white sorghum; (2) non-tannin red sorghum; (3) Type II sorghum; and (4) Type III sorghum [4, 12]. Pericarp color and its intensity are not a reliable indicator of tannins in sorghums [13], and it is erroneously believed that all sorghums with a red or brown pericarp have tannins [12]. Sorghums with a white, lemon-yellow, red, brown, or black pericarp may or may not have tannins depending upon the presence of a pigmented testa.

The spreader gene $S_{-}$controls the presence of brown pigments, possibly tannins, in the epicarp and endocarp when a pigmented testa is present [4]. Tannin sorghums with a white pericarp and the spreader gene $S_{-}$appear tan-colored or light brown while those
without the spreader gene (ss) appear white. Tannin sorghums without the spreader gene $\left(B_{I_{-}} B_{2 \_-} s s\right)$ are known as Type II sorghums while those with the spreader gene $\left(B_{I_{-}} B_{2} S_{-}\right)$are known as Type III sorghums [9]. The extractability of condensed tannins in Type II and III sorghums differs. The condensed tannins in Type II sorghums ( $\left.B_{1 \_} B_{2 \_s} s\right)$ are extracted with acidified methanol $(1 \% \mathrm{HCl}$ methanol) while those in Type III sorghums $\left(B_{I_{-}} B_{2-} S_{-}\right)$are extracted with either methanol or acidified methanol [4]. The difference in extractability is due to the fact that tannins in Type II and III sorghums are stored differently in the testa layer. In Type II sorghums, tannins are stored in vesicles within the testa layer, whereas the tannins in type III sorghums are stored along the cell walls of the testa and some are present in the pericarp [14]. This may explain why acid (e.g., $\mathrm{HCl}$ ) is required to disrupt the structure of the vesicles to release the tannins in Type II sorghums [14]. In general, condensed tannin concentrations are highest in sorghums containing dominant $B_{I_{-}} B_{2} S S$ genes and these sorghums have high bird and mold resistance $[4,13]$.

Pericarp thickness is controlled by the $Z$ gene $[4,9]$. A pericarp is thick when the genes are homozygous recessive $(z z)$ and thin when they are dominant $(Z Z)$. Sorghums with a thick pericarp have significantly far more starch granules in the mesocarp than those with a thin pericarp [15]. Pericarp thickness may affect the appearance of the grain. In general, sorghums with a thin pericarp have a "pearly" appearance while those with a thick pericarp have a "chalky" appearance [16]. Some white sorghums (rryy or R_yy) with a thin pericarp and yellow endosperm appear yellow in color and could erroneously be classified as lemon-yellow sorghums. Thus, care must be taken when evaluating these genotypes. Pericarp thickness may also have an effect on phenolic concentrations. It has been reported that sorghum genotypes with a thick pericarp have higher phenolic concentrations than those with a thin pericarp [16].

## 3 Phytochemical Compounds in Sorghum Grain

### 3.1 Phenolic Acids

All sorghum genotypes contain phenolic acids, which are located in the pericarp, testa, aleurone layer, and endosperm [17]. Phenolic acids consist of two classes: hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids. Hydroxybenzoic acids are directly derived from benzoic acid and they include gallic, protocatechuic, $p$-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, and syringic, acids. The hydroxycinnamic acids have a C6-C3 structure and they include caffeic, $p$-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic acids.

Sorghum phenolic acids are found in free and bound forms [18]. Free phenolic acids are located in the pericarp, testa, and aleurone layer and they are extracted in organic (e.g., methanol) or aqueous organic solvents (e.g., 70 or $80 \%$ methanol)

[18-20]. Bound phenolic acids are esterified to the cell walls and are extracted either in alkaline solution (e.g., $2 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaOH}$ ) or in boiling $2 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{HCl}$ [18-20]. Phenolic acids in sorghum are present mostly in bound form with ferulic acid being dominant (24-76\%) $[18,19]$. Gallic, sinapic, and diferulic acids have been detected only in bound forms $[18,19]$. Protocatechuic, $p$-hydoxybenzoic, vanillic, caffeic, $p$-coumaric, and cinnamic acids have been reported in both free and bound forms [18]. Grain hardness affects phenolic acid concentrations where hard sorghum varieties have higher phenolic acid concentrations $(310-383 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{g})$ than soft varieties $(107-163 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{g})[19]$.

Several glycerol esters of phenolic acids have also been identified in sorghum. They include 2-O-caffeoyl-glycerol, 1-O-caffeoyl-glycerol, 2-O-coumaroyl-glycerol, 1,3-O-dicaffeoyl-glycerol, 1,3-coumaroyl-caffeoyl-glycerol, l,3-coumaroyl-feruloyl-glycerol, 1,3-Odicoumaroyl-glycerol, and 1,3-O-diferuloyl-glycerol [20-22]. These compounds have been reported in sorghums with white and red/brown pericarps [20-22].

3.2 Flavonoids
Many sorghum flavonoids have been isolated and identified over the years (Table 1), which include 3-deoxyanthocyanins, flavan-4-ols, flavanones, flavones, and flavonols (Fig. 4). Anthocyanins are pigments that contribute to the reds, blues, and purples, in fruits, vegetables, and flowers. Sorghum anthocyanins are unique since, unlike the anthocyanidins (e.g., cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, petunidin, peonidin), they lack the hydroxyl group at the 3-position of the $\mathrm{C}$-ring and thus are called 3 -deoxyanthocyanins. Sorghum is the only dietary source of those compounds [27]. The two major 3-deoxyanthocyanidins are the yellow apigeninidin and the orange luteolinidin. The lack of the hydroxyl group at the 3-position of the C-ring is reported to increase pigment stability at higher $\mathrm{pH}$ and temperature [29, 35-37], which make these pigments good candidates for natural food colorants. The 3-deoxyanthocyanins are also phytoalexins since they are produced as a response to mold invasion or other stresses in sorghum $[2,28]$. Apigeninidin, luteolinidin, 5methoxyluteolinidin, and 7-methoxyapigeninidin are the four major 3-deoxyanthocyanidins identified and quantified in sorghum [10, 23-27]. Other sorghum 3-deoxyanthocyanins identified include apigeninidin-5- $O$-glucoside, luteolinidin-5- $O$-glucoside, 5-methoxyluteolinidin-7-O-glucoside, and 7-methoxyapigeninidin-5-O-glucoside (Table 1) [27].

Sorghum 3-deoxyanthocyanins are located in the bran fraction and their concentrations are 3-4 times higher than in the grain [30]. Sorghums with a black pericarp have the highest concentrations of 3-deoxyanthocyanins (329-1054 $\mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{g}$ ) and their concentrations are increased in darker grains [24]. However, it cannot be concluded that high concentrations of 3-deoxyanthocyanins lead to

a darker or black pericarp since it is unknown as to what compounds contribute to its black color [24]. Secondary plant color also affects 3-deoxyanthocyanin concentration, as well as their composition. Sorghums with purple or red secondary plant color are reported to have higher concentrations of 3-deoxyanthocyanins $(8-680 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{g})$ than those with tan secondary plant color (nd-1.5 $\mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{g}$ ) [10,23]. Apigeninidin and 7-methoxyapigeninidin are reported to be the main 3-deoxyanthocyanidins in sorghums with red secondary plant color which, combined, account for $66-89 \%$ of the total $[10,23]$. On the other hand, luteolinidin and 5-methoxyluteolinidin are reported to be the main 3 -deoxyanthocyanidins in sorghums with purple secondary plant color which, combined, account for $57-81 \%$ of the total $[10,23]$.

Flavan-4-ols (e.g., luteoforol, apiforol) are a group of compounds that are produced from flavanones (e.g., eriodictyol, naringenin) and may be precursors of 3-deoxyanthocyanins [38]. Sorghums with a black pericarp have the highest flavan-4-ol concentrations, followed by those with a red pericarp and purple/red secondary plant color [16, 39]. However, not all sorghums with a red pericarp have detectable flavan-4-ols $[39,40]$. Some genotypes with a white pericarp are reported to have flavan-4-ols as well $[16,39-43]$. Pericarp thickness may affect flavan-4-ol concentrations. One study reported that sorghums with purple/red secondary plant color and a thick pericarp had higher concentrations of flavan-4-ols (4.3-9.3 abs $/ \mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{g})$ than those with purple/red secondary plant color and a thin pericarp $(3-4 \mathrm{abs} / \mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{g})$ and those with $\tan$ secondary plant color (2-3 abs $/ \mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{g}$ ) [16]. Flavan-4-ols may play a role in mold resistance as several studies report a correlation between flavan-4-ols concentration and mold resistance in sorghums [40-44]; however, these findings have been ineffective in selecting sorghums with mold resistance [4].

Flavones (Fig. 4) are a group of flavonoids that are generally associated with herbs and vegetables. Luteolin and apigenin are two main flavones reported in sorghum [10,20-24]. Other flavones identified include 7-methoxyapigenin, 7-methoxyluteolin, apigenin-6- $C$-glucoside, apigenin-4'- $O$-glucoside, apigenin-7- $O$-glucoside, chrysoeriol hexoside, and tricin [21,22] (Table 1). Flavones are located in the pericarp and their concentrations increase almost four-folds in the bran fraction [10]. Pericarp and secondary plant colors affect flavone concentrations. These compounds are predominant in red or lemon-yellow sorghums with tan secondary plant color $(60-394 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{g})[10,23,26]$, which make these genotypes a good source of flavones (Fig. 5). Sorghums with a white pericarp and tan secondary plant color also contain flavones but their concentrations $(1-65 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{g})$ are comparable to those with purple or red secondary plant color (nd-67 $\mathrm{gg} / \mathrm{g}$ ) $[10,23,26]$.

Flavanones (Fig. 4) are another group of flavonoids and they are mostly associated with citrus fruits. Eriodictyol and naringenin are the two major flavanones quantified in sorghum $[10,20,23$, $24,26]$. Other flavanones reported include eriodictyol-5- $O$-glucoside, eriodictyol-7-O-glucoside, homoerioedictyol, and naringenin-7-O-glucoside (Table 1) [20-22]. Flavanones are also located in the pericarp and their concentrations are affected by pericarp color [24]. Sorghums with a lemon-yellow pericarp $\left(r r \Upsilon_{-}\right)$have higher flavanone concentrations $(308-1823 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{g})$ than other genotypes (nd-382 $\mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{g}$ ) [23-26]. Decorticating lemon-yellow sorghums to produce bran increases flavanone concentrations four-folds [23]. The high flavanone concentrations

### 3.3 Condensed Tannins

make these genotypes a good source of these compounds since their concentrations are higher than those found in citrus fruits on an as-is-basis (Fig. 6).

Other flavonoids identified in sorghum include the flavonols quercetin [21] and kaempferol-3-rutinoside-7-glucuronide [31]. The dihydroflavonols taxifolin and taxifolin-7-O-glucoside have also been isolated $[20,21,32]$.

Sorghums with the $B_{1-} B_{2-}$ gene contain tannins, which are the major phenolic compounds in those genotypes [17]. These compounds contribute to some resistance to molds and deterioration of the grain [11]. In general, type II and III sorghums have tannin concentrations of $0.6-1.6$ and $1.1-3.7 \mathrm{mg} / 100 \mathrm{mg}$ catechin equivalents, respectively [13]. The tannins in these sorghums are of the condensed types and they are also known as proanthocyanidins, or procyanidins. Tannic acid, a hydrolyzable tannin, has never been found in sorghum even though some studies report tannin concentrations as tannic acid equivalents/g $[4,12]$.

Proanthocyanidins or condensed tannins are mainly polymers of flavan-3-ols units and are grouped into two types based on their interflavan linkages: A-type and B-type. A-type proanthocyanidins (Fig. 7) consist of flavan-3-ol units linked by $\mathrm{C} 4 \rightarrow \mathrm{C} 8$ interflavan bonds and by an additional ether bond between $\mathrm{C} 2 \rightarrow \mathrm{C} 7$, which have been identified mostly in cranberries [45, 46]. B-type proanthocyanidins (Fig. 7) consist of polymerized flavan-3-ol and/or flavan-3,4-diol units linked by $\mathrm{C} 4 \rightarrow \mathrm{C} 8$ interflavan bonds. The proanthocyanidins in tannin sorghums are mostly of the B-type with (-)-epicatechin as extension units and catechin as

Heteropolyflavan-3-ols with both Aand B-type interflavan linkages with catechin/epicatechin or gallocatechin/epigallocatechin as extension and terminal units (Fig. 7) have been identified $[48,49]$. Glucosylated heteropolyflavans with either proluteolinidin or proapigeninidin flavan as extension units and the flavonones eriodictyol or eriodictyol-5- $O-\beta$-glucoside as terminal units (Fig. 7) have also been identified $[32,48]$.

Polycosanols and phytosterols are compounds associated with the lipid fraction of sorghum grain [6]. Reported polycosanol concentrations in polished and unpolished sorghums are 10 and $75 \mathrm{mg} /$ $100 \mathrm{mg}$, respectively, which are significantly higher than those reported in brown maize $(0.2 \mathrm{mg} / 100 \mathrm{mg})$, rice $(2 \mathrm{mg} /$ $100 \mathrm{mg}$ ), and unpolished purple rice $(4 \mathrm{mg} / 100 \mathrm{mg}$ ) [50]. Campesterol, stigmasterol, and $\beta$-sitosterol have been identified in sorghum with $\beta$-sitosterol being dominant $[51,52]$. The stilbenes trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid are also reported in red sorghum with trans-piceid being dominant $(\leq 1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg})$ [53]. In addition, the phenolamides $N^{1}, N^{4}$-dicaffeoyl spermidine, $N^{1}, N^{8}$-dicaffeoyl spermidine, and $N^{l}, N^{8}$-caffeoyl-feruloyl spermidine have been identified in white and red/brown sorghums [21].

## 4 Potential Contribution of Sorghum and Their Phytochemicals to Health

### 4.1 Sorghum

 Phenolics and Their Antioxidant Activity Potential4.2 Antidiabetic Properties
Sorghum has consistently been shown to have antioxidant activity potential in vitro, which is contributed by phenolic compounds $[16,39,54]$. Sorghums with a pigmented testa for the presence of condensed tannins have the highest antioxidant activity potential among all genotypes $[16,39,54]$. They approach or exceed the antioxidant levels of fruits and vegetables (Fig. 8). The elevated antioxidant activity potential of tannin sorghums is not surprising since condensed tannins have been shown to be more potent antioxidants than monomeric phenolic compounds [55]. Decortication of sorghum to produce bran increases sorghum phenolics and antioxidant activity potential $3-5$ times over the original grain (Fig. 8) $[54,56]$. The antioxidant activity potential of sorghum extracts is strongly correlated to total phenols $[16,39,54]$ and condensed tannins $[24,39]$. A strong correlation between antioxidant activity and flavan-4-ol levels $(r=0.88)$ among non-tannin sorghums with a red pericarp has been reported as well [16]. However, this correlation has not been found in tannin sorghums with a black pericarp [24].

Antidiabetic properties of sorghum have been reported in several studies. For example, tannin and black sorghum bran are reported to inhibit protein glycation and thus have potential use for diabetic

4.3 CholesterolLowering Properties or other metabolic syndrome patients [57]. In another study, rats that were fed a high-fat-fructose diet with tannin whole sorghum flour had decreased fasting glucose, improved glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and reduced insulin secretion [58]. The antidiabetic properties of sorghum extracts were also investigated. One in vitro study demonstrated that sorghum extracts had elevated inhibitory activities against $\alpha$-glucosidase and inhibitory degradation of starch by pancreatic and salivary $\alpha$-amylase [59]. Park et al. [60] reported that mice fed a high-fat diet containing $1 \%$ sorghum extract had reduced serum glucose and insulin concentrations [60]. It was suggested the hypoglycemic effect of the sorghum extract was due to increased PPAR $-\gamma$ expression in adipose tissue, which then increased adiponectin expression and decreased TNF- $\alpha$ expression [60]. In another study, diabetic rats that were orally administered sorghum extracts had lower serum glucose concentration, which was reported to be a result of the inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis via suppression of PEPCK and p38 expressions while increasing p-AMPK expression [61].

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, killing about 610,000 people annually [62]. One of the key risk factors for heart disease is high blood cholesterol, and people with high blood cholesterol double their risks of heart disease [62]. Thus, lowering blood cholesterol is one of the main strategies to decrease the risks of heart of disease. Several reports on the

4.4 Antiinflammatory Properties
4.5 Anticancer Properties cholesterol-lowering properties of sorghum exist. In one study, guinea pigs fed low tannin sorghum had significantly lower cholesterol levels than those fed whole wheat, rolled oats, or pearl millet [63]. Sorghum grain lipid extracts were found to decrease plasma non-HDL cholesterol, liver cholesteryl esters, and cholesterol absorption in vivo, and it was suggested the cholesterol reduction was contributed by phytosterols [64]. In another report, mice and diabetic rats fed a high-fat diet containing $0.5-1 \%$ sorghum extracts had lower levels of serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides compared to those fed a high-fat diet [60]. Kim et al. [65] demonstrated the oral administration of sorghum extracts in mice suppressed HMGCR, SREBP2, and FAS expressions and caused an increase in p-AMK expression, which reduced hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. They also demonstrated that sorghum extracts increased CYP7Al expression, which increased hepatic cholesterol metabolism via bile acid biosynthesis [65]. Phytochemical components that contributed to cholesterol reduction were not identified in those three reports.

Chronic inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory joint disease and skin aging, are increased by hyaluronidase activity [66]. One study reported that tannin sorghum reduced hyaluronidase activity in vitro [66]. In a separate study using mice, a black sorghum bran extract was found to inhibit the secretion of both TNF- $\alpha$ and IL- $1 \beta$, two pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous inflammatory conditions [67]. In addition, the study also demonstrated that both black and tannin sorghum bran extracts also significantly reduced edema in inflamed ears [67]. Moraes et al. [68] reported that rats fed a hyperlipidic diet containing non-tannin red sorghum flour exhibited lower concentrations of TBARS in the liver and TNF- $\alpha$ in the epidymal adipose tissues, which suggested that sorghum can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation associated with obesity. Sorghum brans rich in condensed tannins and 3-deoxyanthocyanins may also be beneficial in the intervention of inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis. In an in vivo study, sorghum brans rich in condensed tannins and 3-deoxyanthocyanins were found to have the potential to protect against alterations observed during dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-colitis to include microbial diversity and richness, as well as dysbiosis [69]. A recent study reported these same sorghum brans could also have the potential to suppress symptoms reported in DDS-colitis such as weight loss and bloody diarrhea $[70]$.

Anticancer properties of sorghum and their phenolic components have been examined. Two studies reported that populations consuming sorghum and millet had lower incidences of esophageal cancer compared to those consuming wheat or maize

[71, 72]. Turner et al. [73] demonstrated that black and tannin sorghum brans could have the potential to reduce colon carcinogenesis. In that study, rats fed diets containing black or tannin sorghum bran had fewer aberrant crypts than those that were fed diets containing cellulose or white sorghum bran [73]. It was suggested the reduction of aberrant crypts could be due to the elevated antioxidant activity potential of black and tannin sorghum brans, which resulted in the reduction of oxidative stress involved in colon cancer development [73].

Anticancer properties of sorghum phenolic extracts were investigated but most of the studies were performed in vitro. In one report, a sorghum extract rich in phenolics was demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation and colonization of ovarian cancer cells and to chemosensitize those cells to the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel [74]. In a recent study, Ryu et al. [75] reported a sorghum extract containing phenolic acids and flavonoids decreased the proliferation of PC3M prostate cancer cells, increased apoptosis rate, induced cell cycle arrest, and reduced cell migration and expression of MMP2 and MMP9. In the same study, the phenolic extract was also found to reduce growth and metastasis of prostate cancer in vivo without major side effects such as weight loss [75]. In another report, extracts rich in condensed tannins and 3-deoxyanthocyanins were shown to reduce the proliferation of both colon HT-29 and esophageal (OE33) cancer cell lines [76]. Gomez-Cordoves et al. [77] demonstrated that sorghum condensed tannins increased melanogenic activity without increasing total melanin and reduced the formation of human melanoma colony cells. In a recent study, sorghum bran extracts rich in condensed tannin were also found to inhibit proliferation and migration of HepG2 liver cancer cell lines through the activation of the AMPK $\alpha$ pathway and inhibition of MAPK pathway [78]. Sorghum 3-deoxyanthocyanins were found to have anticancer properties in leukemia (HL-60), hepatoma (HepG2 and Hepalclc7), and colon cancer (HT-29) cell lines $[79,80]$. These compounds were also found to inhibit the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines [81], which were reported to be mediated by the stimulation of the $\mathrm{P}^{53}$ gene and the downregulation of the $\mathrm{Bcl}-2$ gene [82]. Woo et al. [83] found the 3-deoxyanthocyaninidin apigeninidin induced apoptosis in leukemia HL-60 cancer cells by the activation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bak and Bax, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, release of mitochondrial cytochrome $c$ and AIF into the cytoplasm, and activation of enzymes caspase- 9 and caspase-3.

4.6 Health Potential of Sorghum Flavones and Flavanones
Since some sorghum genotypes are rich sources of flavones and flavanones, they may have potential health applications that should be investigated [7]. For instance, flavones were reported to have anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, estrogenic, and
analgesic properties $[22,84-89]$. These compounds were also demonstrated as effective vascular relaxation agents, and they could be used for the treatment of corneal neovascularization $[90,91]$.

Lemon-yellow sorghums are a rich source of flavanones and potential health properties of these genotypes should also be explored. Several potential health benefits of flavanones were reported and reviewed in the literature [7, 23]. Potential health benefits for eriodictyol include anti-inflammatory properties [92], prevention of pulmonary valve insufficiency [93], protection of skin cells from UV-induced damage [94], and reduction in the development of age-related macular degeneration [95]. Potential health benefits for naringenin include cholesterol-lowering $[96,97]$ and anti-ulcer properties [98]. Naringenin was also reported as an expectorant [99] and as a chemopreventive agent against neurodegenerative disease [100].

## 5 Conclusion

Sorghum contains a wide variety of phytochemicals and their levels and compositions are affected by the genotype. Studies on the potential health benefits of sorghum rich in phytochemicals have significantly increased in the past 15 years showing promising results. However, these studies have been performed either in vitro or in animal models. Human trials investigating the health-promoting properties of these sorghum genotypes are much needed.
