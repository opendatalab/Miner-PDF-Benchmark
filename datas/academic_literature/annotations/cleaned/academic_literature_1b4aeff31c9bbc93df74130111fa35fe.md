#### Abstract

CdTe} / \mathrm{CdS}\) heterostructures are analyzed in terms of a $p-i-n$ model in which the $i$ layer consists of a $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x} \mathrm{~S}_{x}$ solid solution resulting from $\mathrm{Te}$ and $\mathrm{S}$ diffusion into $\mathrm{CdS}$ and $\mathrm{CdTe}$, respectively. The lattice parameters of the solid solution are determined. The $i$ layer is shown to be too thick for tunneling.


## INTRODUCTION

In the fabrication of heterostructures, high-resistivity layers often appear at heterojunctions [1]. The study of the formation and properties of such layers is of scientific and technological interest because they may offer an effective means of controlling the physical properties and enhancing the performance of semiconductor heterostructures.

In this paper, we present evidence for the formation of a high-resistivity $i$ layer at $\mathrm{CdTe} / \mathrm{CdS}$ heterojunctions and analyze the effect of this layer on the photoelectric properties of the heterostructure.

## EXPERIMENTAL

$\mathrm{CdTe} / \mathrm{CdS}$ heterostructures $1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ in area (Fig. 1) were fabricated as described elsewhere [2]. The front contact in the form of a comb was made by thermal evaporation $\left(\sim 10^{-3} \mathrm{~Pa}\right)$ of indium. The width of the contact strips was $0.8 \mathrm{~mm}$, and the contact separation was $\sim 2 \mathrm{~mm}$. The back contact was made of molybdenum.

The elemental composition of the $\mathrm{CdTe} / \mathrm{CdS}$ interface was determined using an electron probe x-ray microanalyzer (Cameca). The samples were taper-polished at a tilt angle of $1.5^{\circ}$. Analyses were performed at $25-\mu \mathrm{m}$ intervals, corresponding to depth profiling with a step of $0.65 \mu \mathrm{m}$.

The phase composition of the interfacial layer was determined by x-ray diffraction on a DRON-1UM diffractometer $\left(30 \mathrm{kV}, 20 \mathrm{~mA}, \mathrm{Cu} K_{\alpha}\right.$ radiation, $\lambda_{\alpha_{1}}=$ $1.5405 \AA, \lambda_{\alpha_{2}}=1.5443 \AA$ ). In determining lattice parameters, measurements were made in the step-scan mode with a step size $\Delta(2 \theta)=0.01^{\circ}$ and a counting time of $20 \mathrm{~s}$ per data point. The lattice parameter was determined as

$$
a=d_{h k l} \sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}+l^{2}}
$$

For $2 \theta=56.9^{\circ}$, we obtained $a=5.8935 \AA$, which is intermediate between the lattice parameters of CdS $(a=5.832 \AA)$ and $\mathrm{CdTe}(a=6.423 \AA)$. This attests to the formation of an interfacial layer which differs in properties from $\mathrm{CdTe}$ and $\mathrm{CdS}$. Therefore, the heterostructure consisted of $p-\mathrm{CdTe}, \mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x} \mathrm{~S}_{x}$, and $n-\mathrm{CdS}$ layers.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 2 shows the composition-depth profile of a $\mathrm{CdTe} / \mathrm{CdS}$ heterostructure. The interface is seen to be rather sharp. Note that the $\mathrm{CdTe}$ and $\mathrm{CdS}$ layers are enriched in $\mathrm{Te}$ and $\mathrm{Cd}$, respectively, and are, accordingly, $p$ - and $n$-type. In addition, $\mathrm{S}$ atoms diffuse into $\mathrm{CdTe}$, similar to what was reported in [3-5], and $\mathrm{Te}$ atoms diffuse into CdS to a depth of $\sim 1 \mu \mathrm{m}$. These results point to the formation of an interfacial layer con-

sisting of a $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-} \mathrm{S}_{x}$ solid solution. A similar layer was found in [3-5] by near-field scanning optical microscopy.

Given that $\mathrm{CdTe}$ is polycrystalline, we infer from the data in Fig. 2 that the interfacial layer is nonuniform in thickness. Therefore, its conductivity type and electrical parameters are difficult to determine.

To assess the spectral distribution of photosensitivity, we measured the short-circuit photocurrent through $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x} \mathrm{~S}_{x} / \mathrm{CdTe}$ and $\mathrm{CdS} / \mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x} \mathrm{~S}_{x} / \mathrm{CdTe}$ heterostructures (Fig. 3) at photon energies from $E_{\mathrm{g} 1}$ (band gap of $\mathrm{CdTe}$ ) to $E_{\mathrm{g} 2}$ (band gap of $\mathrm{CdS}$ ). $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x} \mathrm{~S}_{x} / \mathrm{CdTe}$ heterostructures were produced by dissolving away $\mathrm{CdS}$ in $\mathrm{HCl}$, followed by applying indium contacts to the surface of the solid solution. As seen in Fig. 3, the two types of heterostructures have identical long-wavelength limits of photosensitivity, whereas the short-wavelength limit in $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x} \mathrm{~S}_{x} / \mathrm{CdTe}$ lies at lower energies in comparison with $\mathrm{CdS} / \mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x} \mathrm{~S}_{x} / \mathrm{CdTe}$.

Note that the photosensitivity of $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x} \mathrm{~S}_{x} / \mathrm{CdTe}$ heterostructures is substantially lower than that of $\mathrm{CdS} / \mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x} \mathrm{~S}_{x} / \mathrm{CdTe}$. This seems to be due to the absence of any barrier between $\mathrm{CdS}$ and the solid solution, the formation of surface states after CdS removal, the low potential barrier between the $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x} \mathrm{~S}_{x}$ and CdTe layers, and the significant thickness of the interfacial layer.

The spectral dependence of the photocurrent through $\mathrm{CdS} / \mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x} \mathrm{~S}_{x} / \mathrm{CdTe}$ heterostructures was studied in the photodiode mode at room temperature and different reverse biases $V_{\mathrm{r}}$. We found two peaks in

photocurrent, at $\lambda_{1} \simeq 600 \mathrm{~nm}$ and $\lambda_{2} \simeq 800 \mathrm{~nm}$. In addition, the photocurrent was shown to increase steadily with increasing $V_{\mathrm{r}}$. At $V_{\mathrm{r}}=-2 \mathrm{~V}$, the photosensitivity at $\lambda_{2} \simeq 800 \mathrm{~nm}$ is $\sim 0.9 \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{W}$, which exceeds the zero-bias photosensitivity by about a factor of 3 . Note also that, with increasing reverse bias, the peaks in the photocurrent become sharper. Moreover, the spectral position of the shorter wavelength peak depends on the heterostructure fabrication procedure. These results suggest that the interfacial layer (responsible for the increased short-circuit photocurrent) consists of a high-resistivity solid solution [6] and that its composition depends on the fabrication procedure.

Also important is the question of the interfacial layer thickness. The slope of the current-voltage characteristic of the structures under consideration depends on temperature (between 300 and $450 \mathrm{~K}$ ). According to theoretical studies $[1,7,8]$, this is possible if the thickness of the base in a $p-i-n$ structure exceeds the level required for tunneling. Therefore, it seems likely that the electrical transport is not due to the tunneling [1] or excess tunneling [7] mechanism. In analyzing the electrical properties of the heterostructures, the solid solution must then be taken into account as a high-resistivity $i$ layer.

The experimentally determined collection coefficient of the structures studied is $\sim 1$. This implies that the $i$ layer may serve as a base in solar cells. The photocarriers in this layer may easily diffuse to the barrier and be separated there. The short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, and quantum efficiency of the structures under illumination of $100 \mathrm{~mW} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ are $\sim 12 \mathrm{~mA} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}, \sim 0.6 \mathrm{~V}$, and $\sim 8.0 \%$, respectively. The rel-
atively low values of these parameters (e.g., compared to the $\sim 16.5 \%$ efficiency reported in [9]) demonstrate that the structure requires much optimization work.

## CONCLUSIONS

The present results indicate that, during the fabrication of CdTe/CdS heterostructures, a high-resistivity $i$ layer consisting of a $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x} \mathrm{~S}_{x}$ solid solution is formed at the interface. This layer is too thick to assume that the charge transport across $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x} \mathrm{~S}_{x}$ is due to tunneling but, at the same time, too thin to serve as a base in solar cells. The lattice parameter of $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x} \mathrm{~S}_{x}$ is intermediate between those of $\mathrm{CdTe}$ and $\mathrm{CdTe}$.
