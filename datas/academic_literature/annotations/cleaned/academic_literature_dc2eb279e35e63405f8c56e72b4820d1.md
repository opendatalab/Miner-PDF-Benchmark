#### Abstract

The flow in a PEM fuel cell bipolar plate with a diagonal channel structure and across a carbon paper backing layer has been experimentally studied. To examine the flow inside the plate, a liquid analogue preserving dynamic similarity has been used, applying laser-induced fluorescence. This analogy, however, cannot be used to study the flow through the carbon paper, because gas and liquid surface tension are not equivalent and their flow through a porous medium will be different. For this analysis this paper proposes as a novel application, the use of acetone vapor planar induced fluorescence. With this technique, image sequences have been obtained to visualize the gas crossing the backing layer while the plate was filled with acetone-seeded air. It has been demonstrated that the pattern of the flow emerging from the diffusion layer follows that of the pressure distribution in the plate. Hence, even an apparently non-uniform velocity distribution of the reactant gases in the plate could result in an acceptable distribution over the catalyzed electrode if the pressure field is sufficiently smooth.


## 1 Introduction

The growing shortage of fossil fuels, together with new stringent limits in pollutant and greenhouse gases emissions are forcing us to urgently find electricity[^0]

production methods alternative to combustion. Nowadays, a very attractive possibility is the use of fuel cells, devices that generate electricity by a chemical reaction. Fuel cells consist of two electrodes, anode and cathode, with an electrolyte between them that allows the transport of electrically charged particles from one to the other, and a catalyst, which enables and speeds up the reaction. Depending on the electrolyte, fuel cells are usually divided into five different types, namely: alkali, molten carbonate, phosphoric acid, proton exchange membrane and solid oxides. An introductory review on the subject can be found in Larmine and Dicks (2000), and Vielstich et al. (2003).

Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells work with a polymeric electrolyte formed into a thin, very light and permeable sheet, at low temperature (around $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). In general, hydrogen is normally used as the basic fuel, which reacts electrochemically with oxygen producing electricity and heat and, as a byproduct, water. Electrons are removed from the hydrogen atoms in the anode and the resulting protons diffuse through the membrane, migrating towards the cathode. The electrons pass from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit and provide electric power. At the cathode, electrons, protons and oxygen combine to form water. Platinum is generally the catalyst used in both sides of the membrane, bonded to the porous carbon particles that form the electrodes. The anode, membrane and cathode combination is referred to as membrane/electrode assembly, or simply MEA. Each of its sides is usually covered by a backing layer, also called gas diffusion layer (GDL), made of a porous and conductor material, most of the times, a carbon paper or carbon cloth with a wet-proofing treatment. These layers ensure an effective distribution of the reactant
gases to the catalyst on the MEA, plus an adequate draining of the electrons and a correct handling of the water formed at the cathode side. The gases are routed and fed to the backing layers by the bipolar plates. In the case of fuel cell stacks, these elements also provide electron conduction paths from one cell to another. A low performance of the fuel cell energy conversion, as well as a waste of the very expensive platinum catalyst could be expected if the flow is not evenly distributed.

A wide variety of plate structures, producing different flow fields are used in practical applications: among them are, for example, squared spot, interdigitated, serpentine, spirals, cascade and series-parallel, with geometries of various complexity levels. Alternatively, flow through porous carbon or perforated stainless steel plates have also been tested. A comparative analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of some of the above topologies can be found in the reviews by Carrette et al. (2001) or Costamagna and Srinivasan (2001). Recently, Dohle et al. (2003) numerically studied the interaction between the diffusion layer and the flow field exiting a meander channel bipolar plate and when only the flow passes the diffusion layer in a direct methanol fuel cell. They concluded that even a meander structure distributes the reactants non-uniformly on the electrodes.

As recently demonstrated in Barreras et al. (2005), the flow structure inside a bipolar plate can be visualized, applying laser-induced fluorescence in an optically accessible model. In that work, a parallel-channel commercial bipolar plate was studied, covered by a transparent plastic plate. To visualize the flow patterns, hydrogen was replaced by a water/glycerin mixture doped with Sulforhodamine, preserving dynamic similarity. A numerical code to calculate the pressure and velocity fields in the plate was also developed. Experimental and numerical results agreed very satisfactorily. However, knowing the flow field inside the bipolar plate might not be sufficient to be certain of the correct performance of the fuel cell. In particular, an apparently adequate flow behavior can result in a non-uniform gas concentration after the backing layer, with poor distribution of the gases on the catalyzed electrode. Unfortunately, this process is more difficult to be examined experimentally, and the liquid analogue cannot be employed because gas and liquid surface tension are not equivalent and their flow through a porous medium will be different.

In this paper, it is described and demonstrated how acetone vapor planar laser-induced fluorescence can advantageously be applied to this problem to enable visualization of the gas flow from the bipolar plate through the backing layer.

## 2 Experimental setup

The experiments have been performed using an inhouse designed bipolar plate with a rough surface area of $50 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. It is formed by 34 channels $1 \mathrm{~mm}$ deep and $3 \mathrm{~mm}$ wide, separated by ribs with a $1 \mathrm{~mm}$ thickness in a diagonal structure, surrounded by lateral channels all of them with a width of $2 \mathrm{~mm}$. The internal diameter of both inlet and outlet ducts is $2 \mathrm{~mm}$. The plate is shown in Fig. 1. It is important to indicate that this is not an especially favorable design. It has been used in these experiments because their main purpose is to evaluate the usefulness of the experimental techniques.

The flow rates considered have been 1.5 and $5.0 \mathrm{l} /$ min. The ideal standard potential generated by a $\mathrm{H}_{2} / \mathrm{O}_{2}$ fuel cell is $1.17 \mathrm{~V}$ at $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. A typical current density for this device would be located in a range between 400 and $800 \mathrm{~mA} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. If a value of $500 \mathrm{~mA} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ is considered, the total current for a $50 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ PEM fuel cell would be $25 \mathrm{~A}$. Working in the region of ohmic polarization, for voltage values around $0.5-0.7 \mathrm{~V}$ the power that could be expected in a single cell configuration is about $12.5-17.5 \mathrm{~W}$. Considering that the reaction of a $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ flow of $1 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{min}$ would produce a current of 3215.7 A, 25 A will result from the complete reaction of a flow of $7.77 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{min}$. At a typical working temperature of $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, this corresponds to $0.23 \mathrm{l} / \mathrm{min}$. The selected flow rates clearly correspond to flow-in-excess conditions, normally used for PEM fuel cell characterization at the laboratory.

As a first step, following the procedure described in Barreras et al. (2005), the flow pattern in the bipolar plate has been visualized. To do that, a $50 \%$ mixture of glycerin and water has been used as the working fluid. This mixture has a kinematic viscosity value at ambient temperature of $24.1 \mathrm{cSt}\left(24.1 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}\right)$. The main physical properties of hydrogen at $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ relevant to this problem (Perry et al. 1984) are as follows: absolute viscosity $(\mu)$ of $1.05 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~Pa} \mathrm{~s}$ and density $(\rho)$ equal to $0.0674 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$, resulting in a kinematic viscosity $(v)$ of $1.558 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$. For a flow rate of $11 / \mathrm{min}$ the resulting Reynolds number $\left(R e=v_{H_{2}} d / v\right)$ based on the inlet duct diameter $(d)$ is 68 . If $R e$ is preserved, a mixture inlet velocity of $1.22 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ is required, which corresponds to a volumetric flow rate of $230 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. An immersion pump has been used to circulate the fluid. A bypass has been included before the bipolar plate assembly to avoid large pressure drops and,

hence, liquid overheating. This is very important due to the exponential dependence of the liquid mixture viscosity on temperature, which might cause large fluctuations on the flow conditions. The dye injection point, placed $80 \mathrm{~mm}$ (40 diameters) upstream of the inlet point, consisted of a $1 \mathrm{~mm}$ capillary welded at an angle of $45^{\circ}$ with respect to the axis of the inlet duct. A syringe loaded with Sulforhodamine B (Kiton Red) dissolved in the water/glycerin mixture has been used to inject the dye in the fluid stream in a pulsed form to ease the tracking of the dyed front. A transparent plastic cover that seals the bipolar plate constituted the front-face of the experimental model.

To excite the dye, a double cavity Quantel YG781C10 pulsed Nd:YAG laser has been used, doubling the frequency of its emission to obtain $100 \mathrm{~mJ}$ pulses at $532 \mathrm{~nm}$, with a pulse duration of $6 \mathrm{~ns}$. The absorption spectrum of Sulforhodamine B has a maximum at $556 \mathrm{~nm}$, hence excitation at $532 \mathrm{~nm}$ is very efficient (see Brackmann 1994). The fluorescence peak of this dye is located at $620 \mathrm{~nm}$, which allows for an efficient discrimination between the emitted signal and the excitation laser light beam. To further decrease the background light, a Schott OG 550 filter has been placed in front of the camera lens, blocking any $532 \mathrm{~nm}$ reflection from the incident laser beam. An interlined Hamamatsu ORCA-ER CCD camera with a resolution of $1,024 \times 1,024$ pixels equipped with a $50 \mathrm{~mm}$ \#1.2 lens has been employed to record image sequences. The time interval between successive images was set to $0.5 \mathrm{~s}$ and the correlation between them has been analyzed to track the displacement of the dyed liquid front. The optical arrangement for these experiments is sketched in Fig. 2a.

In a second set of experiments, gaseous flow through the backing layer has also been visualized and analyzed. To our knowledge this is a novel application of the fluorescence techniques. The transparent plastic

cover attached to the bipolar plate has been replaced by a carbon paper equal to those actually used in real PEM fuel cells. In this case, and for simplicity, air has been used as working fluid, although the technique should equally work for pure oxygen or hydrogen. The gas has been seeded with acetone vapor, by bubbling the air in a bottle containing liquid acetone. Acetone vapor laser induced fluorescence is a well-established technique. Details of its use can be found in Lozano et al. (1992). The same Nd:YAG laser has been employed to excite the acetone, but in this case, quadrupling the fundamental emission to obtain $266 \mathrm{~nm}$ pulses, with a maximum energy of $70 \mathrm{~mJ} /$ pulse. The laser beam has been formed into a thin sheet propagating parallel and as close as possible to the carbon paper. Three cylindrical fused silica lenses, as depicted in Fig. 2b, have been used for this purpose, two of them to expand the beam and the third to thin it in the imaged area. Transverse images have also been acquired, propagating the laser sheet perpendicular to the plate channels sectioning them along the diagonal shown as a dotted line in Fig. 1, according to the sketch in Fig. 2c. The images have also been acquired with the ORCA-ER Camera and the $50 \mathrm{~mm}$ \#1.2 lens. It is important to indicate that this large lens aperture is beneficial to maximize the signal to noise ratio. In this case, no filter is required to block possible laser reflections, because the camera lens does not transmit UV light.

## 3 Numerical code

The flow distribution in the plate plane has been modeled with a 2-D computer code based on the steady Navier-Stokes conservation equations for mass and momentum. In this simple model, out of plane fluid flow has not been taken into account. To discretize the coupled Navier-Stokes equations, a finite volume method (Ferziger and Peric 1999) has been preferred over finite elements, given the simple geometrical topologies selected for the bipolar plates. A regular Cartesian staggered grid has been used in order to improve the velocity-pressure coupling. This coupling is numerically implemented using a SIMPLE algorithm (see Patankar 1980). Finally, a gradientconjugate algorithm has been applied to iteratively solve the resulting linear equation system.

It should be noted that it is essential to accommodate the 2D numerical simulation to the 3D physical problem to preserve the Reynolds number at the inlet duct. The actual 3D flow rate $\left(Q_{3 \mathrm{D}}\right)$ imposes a 2D flow rate $\left(Q_{2 \mathrm{D}}\right)$ given by $Q_{3 \mathrm{D}}=\frac{\pi}{4} d Q_{2 \mathrm{D}}$.

So, for an actual volumetric flow of $230 \mathrm{ml} \mathrm{min}^{-1}$ and a Reynolds number of 68 , the corresponding $2 \mathrm{D}$ flow rate is $2.44 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, getting the same inlet velocity $\left(1.22 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)$ obtained from the non-dimensional analysis.

A $138 \times 138$ grid has been selected to discretize the flow region, because it has a spatial resolution high enough to simulate with a good precision the flow conditions. Details of the simulation accuracy, together with a thorough discussion about the simplification of the problem to a two-dimensional one and a comparison between experimental and numerical results can be found in Barreras et al. (2005).

## 4 Results

The sequence in Fig. 3 reveals the flow pattern in the bipolar plate by showing the evolution of a dye pulse introduced in the circulating water/glycerin mixture. The time interval between images in the sequence is $0.5 \mathrm{~s}$. It is evident that the velocity profile is highly nonuniform, with the flow preferentially moving along the central channels, followed by those in the lower half of the plate. To have an idea not only of the velocity field, but also about the pressure distribution, results of the numerical simulation are presented too. Figure 4 presents a velocity magnitude map, while Fig. 5 shows a velocity profile along a diagonal line crossing the plate perpendicular to the channels. The non-uniformity observed in Fig. 3 is also reflected in these two figures. Clearly, the highest velocities correspond to the two central channels, with a non-symmetrical pattern unbalanced towards channels to the right of the diagonal. This flow structure is determined by the inlet position and angle. Neglecting gravitational effects, a position perfectly aligned with the diagonal should result in a symmetrical flow field. The inlet channel tilting that causes the asymmetry is equal to that of the commercial bipolar plate described in Barreras et al. (2005) although the plate topology is different here.

Figure 6 is a pressure map obtained from the numerical simulation. Here a strong gradient is visible in the central channels. Again, higher pressures are found in the channels below the diagonal compared to those in the area above it. Not surprisingly, the lowest pressures are located in the region surrounding the plate exit region. Now, a question that might arise is to determine the influence of the velocity and pressure fields in the flow distribution behind the backing layer

(for example, carbon paper) when a gas is circulating in the bipolar plate. Direct visualization is more difficult, because the paper does not allow optical access. Besides, the process cannot be reproduced substituting the gas by a suitable liquid. Here, it is proposed that acetone vapor laser induced fluorescence can be of help to analyze the flow through the porous medium.

Figure 7 displays a sequence of images acquired according to the experimental setup sketched in Fig. 2b when the plate is being filled (from an empty initial situation) with air seeded with acetone vapor. As in Fig. 3, the interval between successive images is $0.5 \mathrm{~s}$. It is quite remarkable to observe how closely the filling pattern follows the pressure distribution depicted in Fig. 6. After crossing the backing layer, the flow comes out first from the zones of higher pressure, that is, from the points where the pressure gradient across the carbon paper is larger. The final situation after $5 \mathrm{~s}$, which might be assumed as steady, is shown in Fig. 8. It can be observed that although some air is emerging from the whole surface of the bipolar plate, it comes out preferentially from the area comprising the diagonal channels and those below them. A dark band in the zone corresponding to the channels immediately above the diagonal can also be noticed. These images have been obtained with a flow rate of $1.5 \mathrm{l} / \mathrm{min}$. If the flow rate is increased to $5.0 \mathrm{1} / \mathrm{min}$, both the filling sequence and the final situation are quite similar. After $5 \mathrm{~s}$, the pattern that is established with this higher flow rate can be observed in Fig. 9. The principal difference between this image and that in Fig. 8 is the small jet directly emerging from the inlet orifice, due to the excess flow.

To complete the analysis, images have also been acquired from an area transverse to the plate extending along the diagonal perpendicular to the channels, as indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 1, with the set up depicted in Fig. 2c. A filling sequence is presented in Fig. 10 for a flow rate of $1.5 \mathrm{l} / \mathrm{min}$, again with images separated by $0.5 \mathrm{~s}$. Initially, a small puff is observed to rise from the center of the plate, most likely corresponding to the air filling the central channels. In the second frame, a more intense flow is observed in the

right side of the image, originating from the channels below the diagonal. This is in good agreement with the flow pattern presented in Fig. 3 and the structure observed in the longitudinal sections in Fig. 7. The final situation, approximately stable, is that shown in Fig. 11. The flow is not completely stationary because of the instabilities caused by movements in the ambient air where the acetone-loaded air is discharging. Some seeded gas is emanating from the whole plate section, but preferentially from the right-hand side.

In general, it is observed that the flow through the carbon paper layer is mostly controlled by the pressure gradient between the bipolar plate and, in the case, the room pressure. Hence, even a non-uniform velocity distribution of the reactant gases in the plate (as visualized with the liquid analogue) can result in an acceptable distribution over the catalyzed electrode if the pressure field is sufficiently smooth. Yet, the nonuniform flow distribution of the gases after the backing layer obtained in this study reveals that the particular design here used is clearly defective and could be easily improved by changing the inlet position or modifying the channel topology. The presence of an area where the flow of acetone-seeded air is very limited will lead to an unbalanced use of the catalyst, and, possibly, to a defective overall efficiency of the fuel cell.

## 5 Conclusions

The flow in a PEM fuel cell bipolar plate with a diagonal channel structure and across a carbon paper backing layer has been experimentally studied. To examine the flow inside the cell, a liquid analogue preserving dynamic similarity has been used, applying laser-induced fluorescence. The evolution of a dyed front has been imaged in a sequence of frames. Results have shown a highly non-uniform velocity field, with higher velocities in the central channels, followed by the velocity in those channels below the diagonal, determined by the inlet position and angle. These results are in good agreement with a numerical simulation of the problem, which has also been used to calculate the corresponding pressure field.

The liquid analogy cannot be used to study the flow through the carbon paper, because gas and liquid surface tension are not equivalent and their flow through a porous medium will be different. For this analysis, this paper has proposed the use of acetone vapor planar laser induced fluorescence. With this technique, image sequences have been obtained to visualize the gas flow emerging from the carbon paper while the plate was filled with acetone-seeded air. It has been demonstrated that the flow pattern follows that of the pressure map. As expected, acetone vapor is detected preferentially in those areas where the gradient between the pressure inside the plate and that in the laboratory is larger. The process has been confirmed by analyzing the images of an area perpendicular to the plate.

It can be concluded that the flow through the carbon cardboard layer is mostly controlled by the pressure gradient. Hence, even a non-uniform velocity



Fig. 11 Image for the same conditions as those depicted in Fig. 10 after an elapsed time of $5 \mathrm{~s}$ distribution of the reactant gases in the plate (as visualized with the liquid analogue) can result in an acceptable distribution over the catalyst if the pressure field is sufficiently smooth. In any case, the plate design in this study is clearly defective and could be substantially improved. Work is in progress to define a channel structure that yields a more uniform velocity distribution with a suitable pressure field. Application of acetone-vapor planar laser induced fluorescence has been demonstrated to be a very useful aid in this task.
