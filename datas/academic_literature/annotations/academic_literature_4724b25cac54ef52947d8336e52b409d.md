#### Abstract

A carcinosarcoma of the cardia of stomach is reported. This is a rare entity which is of further interest because of an associated but distinctly separate carcinoid tumor. The main tumor showed distinct adenocarcinomatous and spindle cell components which collided in many areas. The sarcomatous nature of the spindle cell component was confirmed by ultrastructural studies. We have reviewed the literature and have not found a similar case.

C ARCINOSARCOMA of the stomach was probably first described by Queckenstedt in 1904. 'A number of cases have since been added to the literature. Establishing the diagnosis of carcinosarcoma of the stomach, however, requires critical evaluation of all the qualifying criteria, namely, exclusion of a primary elsewhere, and the presence and admixture of both epithelial and mesenchymal elements on light microscopic study, confirmed by ultrastructural study and special stains. ${ }^{2}$

We have had the opportunity to study a case which not only fulfills the above criteria but is of added interest because of an associated, but distinctly separate, carcinoid tumor. This occurred in a 71 -year-old white man who was treated by an esophagogastrectomy. We could not find a similar case in the literature.

## Case Report

A 71 -year-old white man was admitted to The Mount Sinai Hospital in November 1979 with several months history of progressive dysphagia for solids, $13.6 \mathrm{~kg}$ loss in three months, poor appetite and general weakness.

An upper gastrointestinal $x$-ray series, done at another hospital, revealed a large tumor mass arising from the stomach, close to the esophagogastric junction. A gastric biopsy was

On admission to Mount Sinai, his hemoglobin was $11.6 \mathrm{~g} / 100 \mathrm{ml}$ and the alkaline phosphatase determination was normal. No abdominal mass was palpated. Barium enema and chest x-ray were unremarkable. Laparotomy was performed, and a piece of the gastric tumor was submitted for frozen section. The diagnosis of carcinosarcoma was suggested and an esophagogastrectomy, with reconstruction by stomach tube, was performed. The liver was biopsied at the same time. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged. Chemotherapy was started. However, the course was progressively downhill, due to widespread metastatic disease and nutritional problems and the patient died six months after surgery. Autopsy was not performed.

## Pathologic Findings

The resected specimen consisted of the proximal two thirds of the stomach, a small rim of distal esophagus, spleen, and omentum. A large polypoid exophytic 11.5 $\times 7.5 \times 3.0 \mathrm{~cm}$ tumor was $1.7 \mathrm{~cm}$ from the esophageal resection margin, on the posterior wall, and extended from the lesser to the greater curvature, almost entirely obstructing the gastric lumen (Fig. 1). The surface of the tumor was ulcerated and hemorrhagic, and, on section, the tumor was variegated, with greyish-pink, soft areas interspersed with irregular greyish-white, firm areas, and zones of necrosis and hemorrhage. The entire thickness of the gastric wall was infiltrated and the serosa was congested, with fibrous thickening.

A separate, large, plaque-like $4.6 \times 4.0 \mathrm{~cm}$ ulcerated lesion was on the anterior wall, $3.0 \mathrm{~cm}$ from the greater curvature and $3.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ from the main tumor (Fig. 1). The edges were indurated, rolled, and slightly elevated,
and the lesion consisted of greyish-white, firm tissue infiltrating the entire thickness of the wall. Corresponding to this lesion, the serosa was puckered with a few fibrous adhesions.

The remainder of the gastric mucosa was unremarkable. Several 0.5 to $1.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ lymph nodes were along the greater and lesser curvature; some of these nodes were completely replaced by greyish-white, soft tumor tissue.

The spleen was moderately enlarged, weighing 388 g. The capsule had patchy fibrous thickening and the parenchyma was congested. A few grossly unremarkable lymph nodes were found at the splenic hilum. The omentum was grossly unremarkable.

Histologically, the surface of the large polypoid tumor was distinctly papillary. In the depth of the tumor, the histology varied greatly. In addition to well-differentiated adenocarcinomatous areas, characterized by small tubular structures, there were moderately differentiated tubular and papillotubular areas, extremely anaplastic foci, characterized by small round to polygonal cells with scattered bizarre giant cells, and spindle cells arranged in interlacing bundles (Fig. 2). These components were intermixed throughout the tumor, although the papillotubular and spindle cell elements were most prominent. In some areas, the spindle cell element was sharply demarcated from the carcinomatous areas (Fig. 3). The spindle cell nuclei were vesicular, oval to elongated, with frequent mitoses, and the cytoplasm was indistinct and interspersed with collagen fibers.

The separate flat ulcerated tumor was composed mainly of small uniform cells arranged in ribbons. Mitotic figures were infrequent, although more anaplastic areas resembling oat cell carcinoma were oc-

casionally encountered (Fig. 4). Argyrophilic, intracytoplasmic granules were demonstrable in this tumor with the Grimelius method. The tumor invaded veins and lymphatic channels extensively, and several lymph nodes were replaced by carcinoid or oat cell-like com- ponents. The liver biopsy showed metastatic adenocarcinoma.

For ultrastructural study, tissue from each of the tumors was minced into $1-2 \mathrm{~mm}$ pieces and immediately immersed in $3 \%$ glutaraldehyde with $0.2 \mathrm{M}$ Na cacodylate, buffered at $\mathrm{pH}$ 7.4. After overnight fixation, the tissue was washed in $0.2 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Na}$ cacodylate buffer and then treated with $1 \%$ cacodylate buffered osmium tetroxide for 1 hour. The tissue was serially dehydrated with ethanol and embedded in Epon 812. Thin sections were cut on an LKB III ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a JEOL 100CX electron microscope.

We used the electron microscope to elucidate the nature of the spindle cells of the larger polypoid tumor and to confirm the carcinoidal characteristics of the second tumor.

Spindle cells were surrounded by patches of basement membrane, frequently adjacent to plasma membrane densities (Fig. 5). The nuclei were elongated with irregular borders and appeared twisted. The cytoplasm contained dilated granular endoplasmic reticulum, randomly dispersed polyribosomes, a few lysosomal granules, a few long slender mitochondria, many microtubules oriented along the long axis of the cell, and many microfilaments. The most prominent cytoplasmic feature was the organization of the microfilaments into structures resembling dense bodies of normal smooth muscle cell. These dense bodies were most often found close to the periphery of the cell, but could also be seen deep in the cytoplasm. An occasional pinocytotic vesicle was present at the membrane surface and rare des-

mosomes were observed between adjacent cells. The matrix between cells primarily consisted of individual collagen fibers and collagen bundles.

The cells of the second tumor were in large nests surrounded by a basement membrane; a lumen was not discernible. The nuclei were round to oval and indented with irregular borders. The nuclei contained one to two prominent nucleoli, substantial peripheral heterochromatin, and aggregates of virus-like particles (Fig. 6). The cytoplasm contained dilated granular endoplasmic reticulum, a few small round to oval mitochondria and some lysosomal granules. Most cells showed variable numbers of small membrane-bound homogenous granules, averaging $150 \mathrm{~nm}$ in diameter, with electron-dense core surrounded by an electron-lucent halo. The granules were most abundant in the cytoplasm adjacent to the basement membrane.

## Discussion

Carcinosarcoma is an uncommon entity. Claessen and Mathias ${ }^{3}$ found that over one-half of the 73 cases reported, up to 1921 , had developed from female sexual organs. Saphir and Vass ${ }^{4}$ reviewed 153 cases of socalled carcinosarcoma, reported by 1938 , and found the organs most commonly involved to be in order of frequency, the uterus, ovary, breast, thyroid, esophagus, stomach, larynx, lung, and urinary tract. Kitamura ${ }^{5}$ divided gastric carcinosarcomas into three types according to their gross presentation: (A) predominantly intramural infiltration; (B) extension of tumor beyond the serosa; and (C) predominantly intramural mass as cauliflower-like projections and/or a crater shape. The case reported here belongs to Kitamura's Type C.

Carcinosarcoma is associated with a low incidence of metastases but a high rate of mortality. It is interesting to note that there has not been a significant difference in the incidence in the 30 years prior to and the 25 years after 1938 . Men, usually older than age 50 years (age range, 27-74 years), are affected predominantly. ${ }^{6}$ The average age is lower than that for gastric carcinoma. Most of the cases described occurred in the pyloric region (Table 1), ${ }^{1,2,5,6,15,16,18}$ but the tumor in our case was in the cardia. Clinical diagnosis is impossible and can only be made at operation or at autopsy. ${ }^{6}$

Histologically, carcinosarcoma consists of both epithelial and sarcomatous elements. Meyer ${ }^{7}$ and Fould ${ }^{8}$ each suggested that this type of tumor can be divided into three types: collision (Type I), in which there is a sharp interface between distinct histologic patterns

with no or minimal mixing; combination (Type II), in which the two components mix completely without maintaining discrete stromal components; and composition (Type III), in which the two components mix but maintain recognizable stromal differentiating features. ${ }^{6}$ Stout et al. ${ }^{9}$ and Bergmann et al. ${ }^{10}$ have recognized the improbability, in most cases, of separating Fould's Types II and III. We have, however, grouped the tumor into four classifications (Table 1). Metastases may show either the carcinomatous or sarcomatous pattern, or both. In general, it has been stated that metastases from carcinosarcoma occur later than those from carcinoma, and are especially rare in collision tumors. "

Whether or not the spindle cell component represents a true sarcoma rather than spindle cell anaplasia of carcinoma has been a source of debate. Virchow ${ }^{12}$ and Herxheimier ${ }^{13}$ thought that a primary carcinoma could stimulate excessive stromal growth resulting in carcinosarcoma. When the stromal growth reaches the ma- lignant stage, usually the sarcomatous component is overwhelming. Willis doubted the existence of true carcinosarcoma and suggested that "most of the alleged instances are clearly only cases of pleomorphism in carcinoma." 14

In our case, study of the ultrastructure of the spindle cell element of the large, polypoid mass demonstrated several bundles of microfilaments within the cytoplasm. In some areas, these cells had dense bodies which were both close to the surface and deep within the cytoplasm, thus confirming the true mesenchymal nature of the spindle cells. Whether all these elements differentiated from a single totipotential primitive cell or different cell lines, occurring simultaneously or sequentially, remains unclear. What is clear, however, is that the spindle cells display distinct mesenchymal characteristics and that, in this case, a true carcinosarcoma has been documented. Furthermore, electron microscopy of the distinctly separate carcinoid tumor showed typical neu-
rosecretory granules, and the lymph nodes contained only metastatic carcinoid tumor.
