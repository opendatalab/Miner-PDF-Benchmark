#### Abstract

Mass-energy distributions (MEDs) and capture-fission cross sections have been measured in the reaction ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}+{ }^{208} \mathrm{~Pb} \rightarrow{ }^{256}$ No at the energies $E_{\text {lab }}=206-242 \mathrm{MeV}$ using a double-arm time-of-flight spectrometer CORSET. It has been observed that MED of the fragments consists of two parts, namely, the classical fusion-fission process corresponding to the symmetric fission of ${ }^{256}$ No and quasi-fission "shoulders" corresponding to the light fragment masses $\sim 60-90 \mathrm{u}$ and complimentary heavy fragment masses. The quasi-fission "shoulders" have a higher total kinetic energy (TKE) as compared with that expected for the classical fission. A mathematical formalism was employed for the MEDs fragment decomposition into fusion-fission and quasi-fission components. In the fusion-fission process a high-energy Super-Short mode has been discovered for the masses $M_{H}=130-135 \mathrm{u}$ and the TKE of $\approx 233 \mathrm{MeV}$.

## 1. Introduction

Good results were achieved in the past few years in the experiments on the synthesis of superheavy elements (SHE). The new isotopes of the nuclei with $Z=102-118$ were produced in the reactions with heavy ions [1-3]. However, significant obstruction to the fusion of heavy nuclei and the formation of superheavy nucleus is the quasi-fission process [4-8]. Quasi-fission is a fully damped process in which in contrast to the true fusion-fission the interacting nuclei cannot form a completely fused system inside the fission barrier.

The study of characteristic features of the fusion-fission (FF) and quasi-fission (QF) processes and their relative contribution into the capture cross section allows one to obtain the information about the dynamics of collision, coalescence and decay of the composite nucleus. The ratio of the $\mathrm{FF}$ and $\mathrm{QF}$ cross sections depends on different properties of the reaction entrance channel such as charges $Z_{p}, Z_{t}$, masses $A_{p}, A_{t}$, deformations and orientations of colliding nuclei, the introduced energy and angular momentum. It is known that in the reactions with deformed targets different orientations of the colliding nuclei (prolate and oblate) are possible in the entrance channel, and the prolate configuration is favorable for the quasi-fission process, whereas the oblate configuration leads to the formation of the compound nucleus (CN) [9].

The studied reaction ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}+{ }^{208} \mathrm{~Pb}$ occupies a special place among the ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}$-induced reactions leading to the formation of superheavy nuclei. In contrast to the reactions with deformed targets, only a compact configuration between magic spherical nuclei is possible in the entrance channel of the above-mentioned reaction. As expected, it leads to the true fusion and decreases the QF contribution into the capture cross section. The nuclear structure effects from rotations and vibrations are minimal for these doubly magic spherical interacting nuclei which also has to influence the evolution of the composite system into the compact shape of a compound nucleus. Really the minimal QF contribution to the capture cross section was observed here in the production of elements with $Z=82-116$ [8] in the reactions with ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}$ ions.

Due to the doubly magic structure of the target and projectile the excitation energy of the compound nucleus at the Coulomb barrier calculated according to the Bass model [10] is $E^{*}\left(B_{C}\right)=22.3 \mathrm{MeV}$. This circumstance allows us to study the properties of the FF/QF processes near and below the Coulomb barrier at quite a low excitation energy.

As for the properties of the true fission process of superheavy elements, today it is well known that MEDs of fission fragments have a bimodal nature in the spontaneous fission [11-13] in the $\mathrm{Fm}-\mathrm{Rf}$ region of the nuclei chart. Bimodality means the co-existence of two different types (modes) of fission with special mass (symmetric or asymmetric shapes) and TKE characteristics in the same nucleus. It deals with the valley structure of the Potential Energy Landscape of a fissioning nucleus due to shell effects. The contribution of various modes can be very different in the neighboring nuclei and isotopes. For example, the comparison of mass distributions in the spontaneous fission of $\mathrm{Fm}(Z=100)$ and $\mathrm{No}(Z=102)$ isotope chains shows that a sharp transition from a standard two-humped mass distribution (MD) to a prominent narrow symmetric one occurs with a change in the neutron number in the fissioning nucleus from 157 to 158 in the case of Fm [13] and from 154 to 156 in the case of No chains [14].

At moderate excitation energies ( $E^{*}=10-20 \mathrm{MeV}$ ) shell effects begin to fade away, however the modal structure is still observed. In the reaction of the superheavy nuclei production the excitation energy of nuclei at the Coulomb barrier is usually $\approx 10-20 \mathrm{MeV}$ for "cold" fusion and $\approx 40-50 \mathrm{MeV}$ for "hot" fusion [3] reactions. In this work we measured the MED of fragments of the reaction ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}+{ }^{208} \mathrm{~Pb}$ at excitation energies from $17.6 \mathrm{MeV}$ till $41 \mathrm{MeV}$.

Theoretical calculations made for the superheavy nuclei show that at the potential energy surface in the multidimensional deformation space of fissioning nuclei there exist at least two $[15-17]$ or even three $[18,19]$ fission valleys. One of the valleys, named by Brosa et al. the SuperShort (SS) valley [16] is connected with a possibility for these nuclei to have in both fragments the number of neutrons and protons close to magic numbers $N=82$ and $Z=50$. This possibility will fast disappear at moving from Fm to more heavy nuclei. However, the calculations show $[15,17,19]$ that the SS-valley should exist with the superheavy nuclei up to ${ }^{270,272} \mathrm{Hs}(Z=108)$ and even ${ }^{278} 110$ [15] and ${ }^{290} 110$ [19]. In this work we studied the modal structure in the fragment MEDs of ${ }^{256}$ No at low and moderate excitation energies.

The reaction ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}+{ }^{208} \mathrm{~Pb}$ was studied earlier in several works: the capture-fission cross sections were measured in [4,20,21] the fragment MEDs in [4,22], evaporation residues cross sections in [23]. The purpose of the present work is, first of all, a detailed study of the properties of fusion-fission and quasi-fission processes in this reaction at energies close to and below the Coulomb barrier manifested in the mass and energy characteristics of the fragments. Second, it is the study of peculiarities in the fragment MEDs caused by shell effects (multimodality) in the FF-process. The development of the time-of-flight spectrometer CORSET allowed us to perform this study with quite good mass and energy resolutions. We also report on the total capture-fission cross sections.

The material in the paper is presented as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the experimental procedure of measurements and data analysis. The main results of the experiments are given in Section 3. In Section 4 we discuss the properties of symmetric fission (Section 4.1), quasi-fission (Section 4.2), capture-fission cross sections (Section 4.3), and shell effect manifestation in MEDs of the fusion-fission process (Section 4.4), followed by a summary in Section 5.

## 2. Experimental method and data analysis

The experiment was carried out using a double-arm time-of-flight spectrometer CORSET [24]. Beams of ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}$ ions were produced at the U-400 accelerator of the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (Dubna). The beam currents were $10-20 \mathrm{nA}$, the targets were $180-270 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ layers of ${ }^{208} \mathrm{~Pb}$ evaporated onto $50 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ carbon backings. A kinematic coincidence method $[4,6,25]$ was used for the registration of reaction products.

A schematic drawing of the experimental arrangement is shown in Fig. 1. Each arm of the CORSET spectrometer consists of a Start micro-channel plate (MCP) detector with an electrostatic mirror and two position-sensitive Stop MCP-detectors. Start detectors are installed at a distance of $4 \mathrm{~cm}$ away from the target. The converter foils of electrostatic mirrors of the Start detectors are made from mylar $\left(170 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}\right)$ with evaporated gold $\left(30 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}\right)$ to increase secondary electron emission.

The coordinate system of Stop MCP-detectors is constructed with a delay-line readout technique and allowed one to measure coordinates in- $(X)$ and perpendicular $(Y)$ to the horizontal plane. Two vertical and two horizontal copper strip masks $1 \mathrm{~mm}$ in thickness are mounted at the surface of each Stop detector as $X$ and $Y$ coordinate references. The size of each MCP-detector in the Stop assembly is $6 \times 4 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. The distance between the target and Stop detectors is $15.5 \mathrm{~cm}$,

the solid angle of the spectrometer is $360 \mathrm{msr}$. The spectrometer arms are placed at the angles $\Theta_{1 l a b}=57^{\circ}$ and $\Theta_{2 l a b}=78^{\circ}$ relative to the beam axis. The asymmetrical position of spectrometer arms was chosen to provide more favorable conditions for the registration of fragments with the mass ratio $M_{1} / M_{2} \approx 2.5$, where the quasi-fission component is expected.

Two semiconductor detectors placed at angles $\pm 11^{\circ}$ in the horizontal plane were used as monitors for the cross-section normalization.

A CAMAC based data acquisition system was used for data collecting. The detected reaction products were recorded into the files on the computer hard disk event by event. Each event consisted of signals from two coincident fragments and included the following parameters (see Fig. 1): time interval between Start1 and Stop1 detectors (time-of-flight $\mathrm{TOF}_{1}$ ), between Start2 and Stop2 $\left(\mathrm{TOF}_{2}\right.$ ), between Start1 and Stop2 detectors (long time-of-flight, $\mathrm{LTOF}_{2}$ ), and between Start2 and Stop1 ( $\left.\mathrm{LTOF}_{1}\right)$, the coordinates of particles in the Stop detectors were $X_{1}, Y_{1}$ and $X_{2}, Y_{2}$. The event was written if the signals from both Stop detectors and any Start detector were registered. The advantage of using two Start detectors is in the possibility to measure in coincidence normal TOF's and long TOF's and hence to determine the efficiency of each Start detector.

The MCP-detectors were home-made while other electronics adapted for the experiment were standard. The calibrations of MCP detectors with electronics were performed before the measurements with the use of a time calibrator ORTEC $462, \alpha$-source of ${ }^{226} \mathrm{Ra}$ and spontaneous fission source of ${ }^{252} \mathrm{Cf}$. Position resolution of the Stop detectors was $\pm 0.5 \mathrm{~mm}$ and the time resolution (FWHM) obtained from the $\alpha$-source of ${ }^{226} \mathrm{Ra}$ was $\sim 180 \mathrm{ps}$.

The measurements of the reaction ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}+{ }^{208} \mathrm{~Pb}$ were made in the energy range $E_{\text {lab }}=$ 206-242 MeV, and the accumulated statistics varied from 473 fission-like events for $211 \mathrm{MeV}$ to $7.8 \times 10^{5}$ for $240 \mathrm{MeV}$.

The data processing was performed in a usual procedure [6,7] assuming two-body kinematics. Primary masses, velocities, energies and angles in the center-of-mass (CM) system of reaction products were calculated from measured velocities and angles in the lab-system using the mass and momentum conservation laws. For the calculation of primary masses and energies the iteration cycle was used which takes into account a change in the velocities due to ionization losses [26] in the target, backing and converter foils of electrostatic mirrors. The time-of-flight calibration was performed by the energies of registered elastically scattered ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}$ and ${ }^{208} \mathrm{~Pb}$ ions. The spectrometer mass resolution (FWHM) was estimated by the peaks of elastic scattering events and was about 2-3 u. The selection of events from random coincidences and incomplete linear momentum transfer was performed event by event proceeding from the analysis of folding angle correlations in the center-of-mass system in- and out-of the reaction plane. Only events corresponding to the full linear momentum transfer (FLMT) were selected for a subse-

quent analysis. A circular contour "FoldXY" which is the circle with the radius $R=5^{\circ}$ and center in $\Theta_{\mathrm{CM}}=180^{\circ}$ and $\Psi_{\mathrm{CM}}=180^{\circ}$ was used for the selection of FLMT events (see Fig. 2). $\Theta_{\mathrm{CM}}=\theta_{1 \mathrm{CM}}+\theta_{2 \mathrm{CM}}$ is the sum of angles in-plane, while $\Psi_{\mathrm{CM}}=\psi_{1 \mathrm{CM}}+\psi_{2 \mathrm{CM}}$ is the sum of angles out-of-plane of both reaction products in the CM system.

Since the fission, the quasi-fission, deep-inelastic, elastic and quasi-elastic scattering are binary processes, the average angle between two reaction products in the CM and its projections on any axis equal $180^{\circ}$. The radius of the circle contour $R=5^{\circ}$ corresponds to $\approx 90 \%$ of the linear momentum transfer [27] for the symmetric fission fragments of the reaction ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}+{ }^{208} \mathrm{~Pb}$ at $E_{\text {lab }}=234 \mathrm{MeV}$. All distributions in Fig. 2 are shown in the logarithmic scale. Fig. 2(a) shows a two-dimensional matrix (TKE, $M$ ) for all registered events. The "FF" contour in this figure separates fission-like fragments from the products of elastic, quasi-elastic and deep inelastic scattering. The products of energy straggling and small-angle scattering in target material and converter foils of the Start detectors are seen as tails (shown within the polygons in Fig. 2(c)), coming from the elastic scattering peak to the mass symmetry with a strong decrease in the TKE [28]. The same data are shown in the coordinates $\left(\Theta_{\mathrm{CM}}, \Psi_{\mathrm{CM}}\right)$ - for all registered events (Fig. 2(b)) and for the fission-like fragments from the contour "FF" (Fig. 2(d)). Fig. 2(c) shows a matrix of the extracted events in the coordinates (TKE, $M$ ), corresponding to the contour "FoldXY" from Fig. 2(b), (d). Re-selected events in this contour are about $88 \%$ from the number of the fission fragment events as well as all the events. It is known that the width of the folding-angle distribution is determined by the following factors: (1) neutron emission from excited fragments, (2) angular resolution of Stop detectors, (3) angular struggling of particles in target, backing and Start detector converting foils, (4) uncertainty in the definition of the reaction point due to a finite size of the target and beam spot. For the energy $E_{\text {lab }}=234 \mathrm{MeV}$ FWHM of folding-angle distributions in- and out-of the reaction plane equals $4.3^{\circ}$. One can see that after

The acceptance of spectrometer arms was $\Theta_{1 l a b}=57 \pm 18^{\circ}$ and $\Theta_{2 l a b}=78 \pm 18^{\circ}$.

applying the circular contour "FoldXY" some part of small-angle scattering events still remain in the matrix (TKE, $M$ ) (within the polygons in Fig. 2(c)). It happens because the calculated folding angles include uncertainties in determining the reaction point due to a finite size of the target and beam, hence some part of re-scattered particles still remain in the (TKE, $M$ ) distribution.

Reaction products in the full mass range from projectile to target masses were registered by the spectrometer. However, since the spectrometer acceptance does not allow one to register all masses and energies of fragments with an equal probability, the corrections to the geometry efficiency were introduced. The calculations were performed assuming the two-body kinematics [6] for the full range of masses and energies (see Fig. 3).

## 3. Results

Fig. 4 shows MEDs of the reaction products for the energies of ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}$ ions $E_{\text {lab }}=211-$ $242 \mathrm{MeV}$. From top to bottom are shown-two-dimensional matrices (TKE, $M$ ), mass yields, normalized for the fragments $(M=60-196 \mathrm{u})$ by $200 \%$, the dependences $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle(M)$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2}(M)$. The reaction products with masses close to those of the projectile and target $\left(A_{p, t} \pm 10\right)$ are elastic, quasi-elastic and deep-inelastic scattering events. The fission-like fragments are separated from the products of elastic and quasi-elastic scattering by the contours on the (TKE, $M$ ) matrices. Dependences of the $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle(M)$ and variance $\sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2}(M)$ on the fragment mass are shown below only for the separated fragments. Fig. 4 shows that at $E_{\text {lab }}=225-$ $240 \mathrm{MeV}$ mass distributions of fragments in the symmetric fission $\left(M=A_{\mathrm{CN}} / 2 \pm 30\right)$ are close to a Gaussian in shape (shown in Fig. 4 by thin solid lines), whereas $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle(M)$ are parabolas. Such a behavior of the above mentioned characteristics of fragments is typical for the fission of heated nuclei and predicted by the Liquid Drop Model [29] or Diffusion Model [30], in which shell properties of a fissioning nucleus become insignificant. At the same time, in the case of light fragments with masses $60 \leqslant M_{L} \leqslant 90$ and complimentary heavy fragments there are the so-called "shoulders" in the MD, i.e., the increased yield of the reaction products as compared with that expected in the classical symmetric fission. To the left and to the right from this region a smooth transition is observed to the events of deep-inelastic transfer $\left(M_{L}<60 \mathrm{u}\right)$ and to the classical compound nucleus fission ( $M_{L}>90 \mathrm{u}$ ). However, it is impossible to indicate exactly the boundaries of the "shoulders". For all the energies of ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}$ ions, the $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle(M)$ values are greater in the "shoulders" mass region as compared with those expected for the classical fission. These "shoulders" in MD, in our opinion, originate from the QF-process. The features of sym-

From top to bottom the following results are shown for the energies of ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}$ ions $E_{\mathrm{lab}}=211-240 \mathrm{MeV}$ : two-dimensional distributions of the reaction products (TKE, $M$ ); mass yields, normalized by $200 \%$ for the fragments $(60<M<196 \mathrm{u})$; the average total kinetic energy $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle(M)$ and its variance $\sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2}(M)$ dependences for the fission-like fragments surrounded by the solid contours indicated in the upper panels. The fits of mass distributions by Gaussians are shown with thin solid lines. $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle(M)$ distributions are fitted by parabola from Eq. (3) (dash-dot lines, see text).

metric and asymmetric parts of the fragment MD separated by contours will be considered in more detail below and the main differences between these two processes will be described. Thus, the fragment MED consists of a quasi-fission and classical fission components. Parameters of the studied reactions and measured integral characteristics of the fission-like fragments are shown in Table 1. Parameters in columns 3-6 were obtained only for the fragments separated in Fig. 4 by contours. For the energies higher than the Coulomb barrier the excitation energies $E^{*}$ were calculated with the use of [31] taking into account the ionization losses of beam ions in the backing and in half-thickness of the target. For energies below the barrier $E_{\text {lab }}<B_{C}$ the excitation energies $E^{*}$ were calculated with taking into account the sharp decrease in the capture-fission cross section with energy.

## 4. Analysis and discussion

The properties of the classical symmetric fission typical of heated nuclei from the second part of the periodic table were studied in detail in the reactions with heavy ions and systematized in the review [32]. It is well known that in the fission of the heated nucleus the mass distribution of fragments is one-humped and close to a Gaussian in shape with the mass variance $\sigma_{M}^{2}$ which increases approximately proportionally to the temperature of the fissioning nucleus, $\sigma_{M}^{2} \sim T$, and the same is also valid for $\sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2} \sim T$. The average TKE does not depend on $E^{*}$ (or $T$ ). The experiments showed that an increase in the angular momentum $l$ of the fissioning nucleus leads to an additional increase in $\sigma_{M}^{2}$ in the case of heavy nuclei with the fissility parameter $Z^{2} / A>30$ and a decrease in $\sigma_{M}^{2}$ in the case of light nuclei with $Z^{2} / A<30[32,35]$. For ${ }^{256}$ No the $Z^{2} / A=40.6$.

To obtain the MED characteristics of the ${ }^{256}$ No symmetric fission we fitted the mass distribution of fragments (Fig. 4) into a Gaussian (G) (Figs. 4, 5).

The mass distributions in the logarithmic scale as a function of parameter $\left(M-A_{\mathrm{CN}} / 2\right)^{2}$, are shown in the left-hand side of Fig. 5. In this presentation the Gaussian is the linear function, and it is seen that starting from approximately $(M-128)^{2} \cong 800-900\left(M_{L} \cong 100\right)$ the experimental values deviate from the Gaussians, describing quite well the initial part of the scale $(M-128)^{2}$.

Fig. 5. Left column: mass yield dependences of parameter $\left(M-A_{\mathrm{CN}} / 2\right)^{2}$ in the logarithmic scale and Gaussian fits (the solid line). Center column: mass yields in the linear scale and their description by the same Gaussian as in the left-hand column. Right column: the extracted "shoulders" for light quasi-fission fragments. The energies of ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}$ beam in the lab-system are indicated.

A similar method for determining the deviation of experimental values from Gaussian fits was used in the study of contributions of low-intensity fission modes in the modal approach [36]. In the center of Fig. 5 the same $G$-fits of MD are shown in the linear scale, and Table 1 presents the variances $\left(\sigma_{M}^{2}\right)_{G}$ of the Gaussians. The extracted quasi-fission "shoulders" for the light fragments are shown on the right-hand side of Fig. 5. They were obtained as a difference between the experimental yields and Gaussians fits:

$$
Y_{\mathrm{QF}}(M)=Y_{\exp }(M)-Y_{G}(M)
$$

As mentioned above, $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle(M)$ is higher in the $\mathrm{QF}$ shoulder mass regions than expected for the FF process (see Fig. 4). Thus, the procedure of the MED decomposition can be performed in accordance with (1) and equation [37]:

$$
\mathrm{TKE}_{\mathrm{QF}}=\left[\mathrm{TKE}_{\exp }-\mathrm{TKE}_{\mathrm{FF}}\left(Y_{\mathrm{FF}} / Y_{\exp }\right)\right] /\left(Y_{\mathrm{QF}} / Y_{\mathrm{exp}}\right)
$$

here the dependence on $M$ is implied for all the values. The experimental dependence $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle(M)$ from Fig. 4 was described by the equation [38]:

$$

where $\eta$ is the mass-asymmetric deformation parameter. The empirical parameter $\rho$ determines the degree of the deviation of the $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle(M)$ experimental dependence from the parabolic dependence of the Liquid Drop Model (LDM) [29], where $\rho=0$. The dependence of the $\rho$-parameter on excitation energies $E^{*}$ is shown in Fig. 6 . The parameter $\rho$ was obtained for the symmetric mass range $\left(M=A_{\mathrm{CN}} / 2 \pm 30\right) \mathrm{u}$. As one can see there is good agreement with the results from the classical fission $[32,39]$ at excitation energies $E^{*}=23.9-41.8 \mathrm{MeV}$. Only at two lowest energies the $\rho$-parameter begins to decrease and sharply falls at $E^{*}=17.2 \mathrm{MeV}$. This difference with LDM theory predictions deals with the manifestation of shell effects in the low energy fission of ${ }^{256}$ No and will be considered in Section 4.4.

### 4.1. The properties of symmetric fission

Following the method applied in [32] we present in Fig. 7 the experimental dependences of $\left(\sigma_{M}^{2}\right)_{G},\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2}$ on the nuclear temperature in the scission point $T_{\mathrm{sc}}$. The nuclear temperature in the scission point $T_{\mathrm{sc}}$ was obtained as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& T_{\mathrm{sc}}=\left(E_{\mathrm{sc}} / a\right)^{1 / 2} \\
& E_{\mathrm{sc}}=E_{\mathrm{LD}}^{*}+Q_{\mathrm{f}}-\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle-\left\langle v_{\mathrm{pre}}\right\rangle\left\langle E_{v}\right\rangle-E_{\mathrm{rot}}^{\mathrm{sc}}-E_{\mathrm{def}}+E_{\mathrm{diss}} \\
& E_{\mathrm{LD}}^{*}=E_{\mathrm{CM}}+\left(\Delta M_{p}+\Delta M_{t}-\Delta M_{\mathrm{CN}}^{\mathrm{LD}}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

where $E_{\mathrm{LD}}^{*}$ is the excitation energy of the nucleus, counted from the ground state of LDM. $\Delta M_{p}$ and $\Delta M_{t}$ are the experimental mass defects for the target and projectile, $\Delta M_{\mathrm{CN}}^{\mathrm{LD}}$ is the LDM value of mass defect of the ${ }^{256}$ No compound nucleus taken from [31], $a=0.093 A_{\mathrm{CN}}$ is the level density parameter [40]. $Q_{\mathrm{f}}$ is the reaction energy for the symmetric fission, $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle$ is the experimental average TKE. $\left\langle v_{\text {pre }}\right\rangle\left\langle E_{\nu}\right\rangle$ is the average energy taken away by pre-fission neutrons $\left\langle v_{\text {pre }}\right\rangle$ calculated as suggested in [41]. The values of $\left\langle v_{\text {pre }}\right\rangle$ taken from the systematics [32] and from experimental works [33,34] are shown in Table 1. $E_{\text {def }}$ is the energy coming from the fragment deformation. $E_{\text {diss }}$ is the energy dissipated from the collective to single-particle degrees of freedom.

The rotation energy $E_{\text {rot }}^{\mathrm{sc}}$ in the scission point was determined according to the equation [42]

$$
E_{\mathrm{rot}}^{\mathrm{sc}}=\ell^{2} \hbar^{2} / 2 J_{\perp}^{\mathrm{sc}}+T_{\mathrm{sc}} / 2
$$

where $J_{\perp}^{\text {sc }}$ is the moment of inertia for the rotation perpendicular to the fission axis, $\ell$ is the average angular momentum of the fissioning nucleus. In the LDM by Strutinsky [43] the scission point is defined as a critical point in which the nucleus looses its stability against decay into two fragments, and is given in units of the spherical rigid moment of inertia $J_{0}$. For the nucleus ${ }^{256}$ No $J_{\perp}^{\mathrm{sc}} \cong 4.3 J_{0}[32]$, therefore

$$
E_{\mathrm{rot}}^{\mathrm{sc}} \cong E_{\mathrm{rot}}^{0} / 4.3+T_{\mathrm{sc}} / 2
$$

It is known from the classical Rotating Liquid Drop Model [44] that

$$
E_{\mathrm{rot}}^{0}=34.54\left(\ell^{2} / A^{5 / 3}\right)
$$

There is no agreement at present about the values of $E_{\text {def }}$ and $E_{\text {diss }}$. They are determined by theoretical models and depend on the character and values of nuclear viscosity (one-body or twobody). It should be taken into account that $E_{\text {def }}$ and $E_{\text {diss }}$ compensate each other to some extent. That is why we following the works $[32,42]$ accepted that $E_{\text {diss }}-E_{\text {def }}=0$. The temperatures $T_{\mathrm{sc}}$ obtained according to Eq. (4) are presented in Table 1. Note that $T_{\mathrm{sc}}$ starts to grow very slowly in the case of high-energy projectiles when there is evaporation of the pre-fission neutrons $\left\langle\nu_{\text {pre }}\right\rangle[32]$.

Fig. 7(a) shows that the values of $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle$ do not depend on $T_{\mathrm{sc}}$ (nucleus excitation) within the experimental errors. This behavior is typical of the fission of heavy and superheavy nuclei. The variance $\sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2}$ (Fig. 7(b)) for $T_{\mathrm{sc}} \geqslant 1.83 \mathrm{MeV}$ increases proportionally to $T_{\mathrm{sc}}$. The crosshatched region of $\sigma_{\text {TKE }}^{2}$ shows the range of variances typical of the classical fission. This region was determined in [32] for the fission of heavy nuclei produced in the reactions with ions with masses $A_{i}<26$, taking into account the growth of $\sigma_{\text {TKE }}^{2}$ with an increase in the angular momentum $l$. In the case of the temperature $T_{\mathrm{sc}}=1.83$ the values of $\sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2}$ do not decrease, and they even grow in the case of $T_{\mathrm{sc}}=1.75 \mathrm{MeV}\left(E_{\text {lab }}=211 \mathrm{MeV}\right)$. This is due to the shell effect manifestation in MEDs of fragments at the low excitation energy of ${ }^{256} \mathrm{No}$.

The dependence of the mass variance $\left(\sigma_{M}^{2}\right)_{G}$ on $T_{\mathrm{sc}}$ for the energies of ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}$ ions $E_{\mathrm{lab}}=220-$ $242 \mathrm{MeV}$ is shown in Fig. 7(c). The crosshatched part of the $\left(\sigma_{M}^{2}\right)_{G}$ values, as in Fig. 7(b), indicates the area of changes in the $\left(\sigma_{M}^{2}\right)_{G}$ values for the classical fission. Since $T_{\mathrm{sc}}$ increases slowly with the projectile energy, the growth of $\left(\sigma_{M}^{2}\right)_{G}$ is to a large extent connected with an
increase in the angular momentum of the fissioning nucleus $l$, where $\left(\sigma_{M}^{2}\right)_{G} \sim\left\langle l^{2}\right\rangle$ as shown in $[32,42]$. In Fig. 7(c) one can see that there is quite a sharp increase in the value of the variance $\left(\sigma_{M}^{2}\right)_{G}$ at $T_{\mathrm{sc}}=1.92-1.93 \mathrm{MeV}\left(E_{\text {lab }}=240-242 \mathrm{MeV}\right)$. The calculated values remain close, but outside the expected boundaries for the classical fission. We suppose that this happens due an increase in the QF drift to mass symmetry with the excitation energy. Thus, we conclude that MED characteristics of ${ }^{256}$ No fission fragments for the symmetric mass range $100<M<156$ is close to the properties of the classical fusion-fission process at $E_{\text {lab }}=220-234 \mathrm{MeV}$. Nevertheless, some deviations from the FF process characteristics are observed in the mass yields at $E_{\text {lab }}=211-218 \mathrm{MeV}$. Also there are some deviations for all studied energies in the dependence $\sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2}(M)$ from the known [38] correlation $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle^{2}(M) / \sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2}(M)=$ const, in the symmetric mass region $M=115-141 \mathrm{u}$. The investigation of this anomalous behavior of variances will be considered below in Section 4.4.

### 4.2. The properties of the quasi-fission process

As is known, the main experimental evidences of the quasi-fission process are the large mass distribution width, much larger than that in the compound nucleus fission, asymmetry in the fission fragment mass-angle distribution and large angular anisotropy [7]. These characteristics deal with incomplete relaxation in the mass asymmetry and $K$-equilibration degrees of freedom. As for the energy characteristics, it was believed earlier that the TKE in QF did not differ from that of FF. Later it was found [32,37] that the TKE on the average was higher in QF then that of compound nucleus fission. It was also shown in [37] that FF and QF fragments could be separated since they satisfied formally a hypothesis on independent fission modes [38,45].

The mass distributions of light $\mathrm{QF}$ fragments for all energies are shown in the right-hand side of Fig. 5. Fig. 8 shows the mass distributions together with energy characteristics for $E_{\text {lab }}=$ $234 \mathrm{MeV}$ and $225 \mathrm{MeV}$. QF mass distributions are shown in Fig. 8(a), (c) and $\operatorname{TKE}(M)$ in Fig. 8(b), (d). It is clearly seen that the TKE for $\mathrm{QF}\left(\mathrm{TKE}_{\mathrm{QF}}\right.$ ) is higher in the region of $\mathrm{QF}$ "shoulders" by 7-15 MeV than that of the FF process, and it is on the whole a parabola in shape, which is also a formal similarity with the modes of classical low-energy fission [46]. However, the parabolic dependence $\operatorname{TKE}_{\mathrm{QF}}(M)$ has a larger width than that of the $\operatorname{TKE}_{\mathrm{FF}}(M)$ $\left(\rho(\mathrm{QF})=0.6\right.$ for $E_{\text {lab }}=234 \mathrm{MeV}$ and $\rho(\mathrm{QF})=0.8$ for $\left.225 \mathrm{MeV}\right)$.

A natural explanation of the MED properties (increased mass yield and the higher $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle(M)$ values in the region $60<M_{L}<90$ ) in the QF process is the manifestation of shell effects. The positions of closed spherical shells with $Z=28$ and $N=50$ are indicated in Fig. 8(a) and Fig. 8(c) by arrows. They were found proceeding from the assumption on the Unchanged Charge Density (UCD). In the case of ${ }^{256} \mathrm{No}$, only the light "quasi-fission shoulder" corresponds to closed shells. The complementary heavy fragment belongs to the mass region $M_{H} \sim 166-$ $196 \mathrm{u}$, and this is far from magic closed shell of ${ }^{208} \mathrm{~Pb}$. The manifestation of shell effects in QF has been discussed for a long time [5,47,48], but those cases were mostly considered in which massive ions interacted with actinide targets (or ${ }^{238} \mathrm{U}$-projectiles with different targets, in the inverse kinematics). In such reactions $[5,8]$ two-humped MD with masses of heavy fragments corresponding to the doubly magic lead $M_{H} \approx 208\left(Z_{H} \approx 82, N_{H} \approx 126\right)$ was observed. In the reactions ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}+{ }^{238} \mathrm{U}$ and ${ }^{244} \mathrm{Pu},{ }^{248} \mathrm{Cm}$ at the excitation energy $E^{*} \approx 30 \mathrm{MeV}$ the influence of magic shells on the properties of $\mathrm{QF}$ of superheavy nuclei also was discovered. In these cases shell structures of both heavy (near ${ }^{208} \mathrm{~Pb}$ ) and light (near ${ }^{78} \mathrm{Ni}$ ) fragments play a significant role. In the considered reaction, ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}+{ }^{208} \mathrm{~Pb}$, a doubly magic lead shell, typical of SHE, in the heavy fragment corresponds to the reaction entrance channel. So, in contrast to the reaction with

The solid line shows a Gaussian describing the symmetric fission (see Fig. 5). The arrows show masses of the fragments with magic values $Z=28$ and $N=50$ calculated in accordance with the UCD. The experimental $\operatorname{TKE}_{\exp }(M)$ (filled circles) and $\mathrm{TKE}_{\mathrm{QF}}(M)$ for the quasi-fission component (open circles) obtained from Eq. (2) are shown for $234 \mathrm{MeV}$ (b) and $E_{\text {lab }}=225 \mathrm{MeV}$ (d). The solid line describes experimental dependence by a parabola according to Eq. (3).

actinide targets the $\mathrm{QF}$ events due to the lead shell are hidden in MEDs under elastic/quasi-elastic and deep-inelastic events.

In order to obtain more information about the properties of the quasi-fission MED the decomposition of the experimental MEDs into different processes (modes) was performed using a method proposed in Ref. [46]. Usually this method is applied for the study of the fission fragment MED in the modal approach. Here we firstly applied it to the study of the FF/QF contribution into the MED of ${ }^{256}$ No. The method needs high statistical matrices and we employed it for the measurements at $E_{\text {lab }}=234$ and $240 \mathrm{MeV}$.

In our case we are considering two independent modes, i.e., the symmetric liquid-drop mode $S$ and asymmetric quasi-fission mode $Q_{1}$ which together form the experimental MED of fragments. For each fixed mass the TKE distribution was described for both modes with the use of the Charlier functions. The dependence of the average total kinetic energy on the fragment mass for each mode was the same as in Eq. (3) and the relation between the total kinetic energy and the kinetic energy variance for each mode is $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle^{2}(M) / \sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2}(M)=$ const $[38,46]$. A relative contribution of each mode was found using a standard computer code MINUIT. The fitting procedure is described in detail in work [46]. The results of the decomposition of MEDs of fission-like fragments into the MEDs of different modes are shown in Fig. 9. The upper panels show the MEDs of fission-like fragments at two energies $E_{\text {lab }}=234$ and $240 \mathrm{MeV}$. The middle panels show the symmetric components $S$. The distributions of the quasi-fission events in the lower panels of Fig. 9 are obtained as a difference between the experimental MEDs and symmetric liquid-drop modes $S$. At the bottom panels the dependences of the average total kinetic energy on the fragment mass $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle(M)$ for the symmetric fission $S$ (solid lines) and the quasi-fission $Q_{1}$ (dashed lines) are also shown.

Fig. 9. The MED of fission-like fragments separated by contours (upper panels) at two energies $E_{\text {lab }}=234$ and $240 \mathrm{MeV}$. The middle panels show the symmetric component $S$ and lower panels the asymmetric one $Q_{1}$ of the MED decomposition (see text). The lines show the dependence of the average total kinetic energy on the fission fragment mass for the symmetric fission $S$ (solid lines) and for quasi-fission $Q_{1}$ (dashed lines).

Both one-dimensional (Fig. 8) and two-dimensional analyses (Fig. 9) lead to the same results: a higher TKE in the region of QF shoulders than that predicted for the true fission; and much greater manifestation of shell effects with $Z=28, N=50$ for the QF process. Meanwhile a two-dimensional analysis in coordinates (TKE, $M$ ) reveals that in the case of the reaction ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}+{ }^{208} \mathrm{~Pb}$ the shape of $\mathrm{QF}$ wings is very similar to that from the reaction of ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}$-ions on actinide targets [8], where the QF process dominates. However, the application of the twodimensional analysis requires high statistics measurements.

Fig. 10. The capture-fission cross sections $\sigma_{c}$ as a function of the Compound nucleus excitation energy $E^{*}: \mathbf{\square}-$ our data, $\Delta$ - the data from [4], o—from [20].

### 4.3. The capture cross sections

The differential cross sections were measured at the laboratory system angles $\Theta_{1 l a b}=57 \pm$ $18^{\circ}$ and $\Theta_{2 l a b}=78 \pm 18^{\circ}$ at the bombarding energies $E_{\text {lab }}=206-242 \mathrm{MeV}$. Two semiconductor monitors were installed to the left and to the right of the beam axis at an angle of $\pm 11^{\circ}$ for the registration of elastically scattered ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}$ ions. The monitors were used for the absolute cross section normalization and control of quality of the beam and its position on the target.

Since we did not measure the angular distribution of fission fragments in order to obtain the integral capture cross sections we used the results presented in [20]. In this paper the same reaction was measured and it was shown that the angular distribution of fission-like fragments did not differ very much (within the experimental errors) from the values calculated for the fusionfission process. Fig. 10 shows the capture-fission cross section in dependence on the compound nucleus excitation energy $E^{*}$ (only the fission-like events separated by contours in Fig. 4 were taken in the calculation of the capture cross section). As one can see from Fig. 10, our data are in good agreement with the data from works $[4,20]$.

In the experiments on the synthesis of superheavy nuclei the ratio of the number of events from symmetric fragmentation, namely belonging to the range of $A_{\mathrm{CN}} / 2 \pm 20 \mathrm{u}$ and $\langle T K E\rangle \pm 25 \mathrm{MeV}$, to the capture events (shown in the (TKE, $M$ ) matrices by contours in Fig. 4) is often used for the estimation of the fusion-fission cross section. For ${ }^{256}$ No this ratio equals $\approx 60 \%$ at the excitation energies $E^{*}=17-35 \mathrm{MeV}$.

### 4.4. Low energy fission of ${ }^{256}$ No

As we mentioned in the Introduction, the bimodal fission of superheavy nuclei manifests itself most prominently in the spontaneous fission of nuclei in the Fm-Rf region. The properties

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_28_2d3111047cf1c2bbfb6cg-16.jpg?height=876&width=835&top_left_y=222&top_left_x=383)

Fig. 11. Mass distributions of fission fragments at $E_{\text {lab }}=211 \mathrm{MeV}\left(E^{*}=17.2 \mathrm{MeV}\right)$ and $218 \mathrm{MeV}\left(E^{*}=22.8 \mathrm{MeV}\right)$ : the total MDs (a), (d) and differential MDs for TKE $>201 \mathrm{MeV}$ (b), (e) and TKE $<201 \mathrm{MeV}$ (c), (f).

of these nuclei may change radically at the excitation, for example from the asymmetric mass distribution in the case of spontaneous fission of ${ }^{256} \mathrm{Fm}$ (sf) $[49,50]$ to the symmetric one in the reaction ${ }^{255} \mathrm{Fm}\left(\mathrm{n}_{\text {th }}\right.$, f) at $E^{*}=6.4 \mathrm{MeV}[49,51]$. For ${ }^{258} \mathrm{Fm}(\mathrm{sf})[11]$ and ${ }^{257} \mathrm{Fm}\left(\mathrm{n}_{\text {th }}\right.$, f) [52,53] the mass distribution changes from a very narrow symmetric to symmetric one also, but a few times wider. With in increase in the excitation energy shell effects start to fade away, but at $E^{*}=10-20 \mathrm{MeV}$ the MED modal structure is still observed.

In work [14] the narrow asymmetric mass distribution was observed in the spontaneous fission of ${ }^{256}$ No with the heavy peak mass $M=138 \mathrm{u}$. The MEDs of fission fragments for ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}$ ions at $E_{\text {lab }}=211 \mathrm{MeV}$ and $218 \mathrm{MeV}$ were shown above in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. There are no pre-fission neutrons at these excitation energies (see Table 1), and hence the real excitation energy of the fissioning nucleus does not differ from the initial one. It is clearly seen that MDs at these low excitation energies are far from being a Gaussian in shape. Flat structured peaks are observed in the region of heavy fragment masses $M_{H} \approx 128-135 \mathrm{u}$. An increased yield of fragments as compared with the Gaussian shape of MD appears in the region of masses $M_{H}=145-155 \mathrm{u}$ at $E_{\text {lab }}=211 \mathrm{MeV}$. At this energy the parabolic shape of the $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle(\mathrm{M})$ dependence becomes very narrow, and parameter $\rho$ equals to -2.2 (see Figs. 4, 6). Thus we observed a strong deviation of the mass distribution from the LDM shape. Such a behavior of fragments in MEDs is determined by the shell effects in the low-energy fission of ${ }^{256}$ No.

The total and differential mass distributions for TKE $>201 \mathrm{MeV}$ and TKE $<201 \mathrm{MeV}$ are presented in Fig. 11 for the projectile energy $E_{\text {lab }}=211$ and $218 \mathrm{MeV}$. In the case of TKE > $201 \mathrm{MeV}$ (Fig. 11(b), (e)) a narrow two-humped structure is distinctly seen in the region of heavy masses $M_{H} \approx 131-135 \mathrm{u}$. The shape of this distribution is very similar to that in the MD of spontaneous fission of neighboring nuclei ${ }^{259} \operatorname{Lr}(Z=103)$ [13,54]. Fig. 11 shows a wide

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_28_2d3111047cf1c2bbfb6cg-17.jpg?height=1098&width=877&top_left_y=231&top_left_x=383)

Fig. 12. TKE distributions for the energies of ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}$ ions $E_{\mathrm{lab}}=211-242 \mathrm{MeV}$. The integral distributions for all masses are shown in the left-hand side, for masses $M=124-132 \mathrm{u}$-in the right-hand side. For the lowest energies $E_{\text {lab }}=211$ and $218 \mathrm{MeV}$ the decompositions of the TKE into two modes are presented for the symmetric mass region.

flat MD in the region of heavy fragment masses $M_{H} \approx 140-150 \mathrm{u}$ at TKE $<201 \mathrm{MeV}$. Such a behavior of the MD low-energy component is also typical of the superheavy nucleus fission, for example for the spontaneous fission of ${ }^{259} \mathrm{Md}(Z=101)$ [11] or ${ }^{260} \mathrm{Md}$ [55]. Thus, one can see that the ${ }^{256} \mathrm{No}$ mass distribution at $E^{*}=17.2$ and $22.8 \mathrm{MeV}$ consists of at least two components (modes).

Fig. 12 shows energy distributions of ${ }^{256}$ No for the energies of ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}$ ions $E_{\text {lab }}=211-$ $242 \mathrm{MeV}$. The TKE distributions for the whole mass range are shown in the left-hand side of the figure; TKE distributions for the symmetric mass range $M=124-132 \mathrm{u}$ (i.e., for the masses whose MD is two-humped, Fig. 11) are shown in the right-hand side. The TKE distributions of the selected symmetric masses practically do not differ from integral distributions at energies $E_{\text {lab }}=220-242 \mathrm{MeV}$. However, at the lowest projectile energies $E_{\text {lab }}=218$ and $211 \mathrm{MeV}$ two components of the TKE appear in the region of symmetric masses, i.e., a low-energy one with $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle_{\text {low }} \approx 200 \mathrm{MeV}$, and a high energy one with $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle_{\text {high }} \approx 233 \mathrm{MeV}$. These TKE values as well as mass yields are typical of the standard and SS modes in the spontaneous fission of superheavy nuclei [13-16]. Thus, we observed here both in the mass and energy distributions the presence of SS-mode in the ${ }^{256}$ No induced fission, although on the whole the contribution of the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_28_2d3111047cf1c2bbfb6cg-18.jpg?height=1010&width=944&top_left_y=222&top_left_x=326)

Fig. 13. The basic characteristics of MEDs at $E_{\text {lab }}=234 \mathrm{MeV}$. Mass yields for various TKE ranges are shown in the left-hand side. The TKE yields for different mass ranges are shown at the right-hand side.

SS-mode is quite small and equals $\approx 2.5 \%$ at $E_{\text {lab }}=211 \mathrm{MeV}$. This minimal contribution of the SS-mode was obtained as a ratio of the sum of the high energy component in the energy distribution (Fig. 12) for masses $M=124-132$ (right column) to the total TKE yield (left column). The same ratio equals $\approx 1.7 \%$ for $E_{\text {lab }}=218 \mathrm{MeV}$ and decreases to $\approx 0.3 \%$ for $E_{\text {lab }}=234 \mathrm{MeV}$ (see Fig. 13).

The clear manifestation of the SS-mode was observed both in the mass and energy distributions at the energies $E_{\mathrm{lab}}=211$ and $218 \mathrm{MeV}$. However, the dependence $\sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2}(M)$ has a moderately wide peak for the masses $M \approx 115-141$ u for all studied energies. The presence of irregularities in the variance $\sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2}(M)$ reveals a complicated MED structure (this property was used in the study of multimodal fission in the region of $\mathrm{Pb}$ and $\mathrm{At}$ [36]). To understand the reason for such an anomalous behavior of the variance we present in the right-hand sides of Fig. 13 the TKE yield for different mass ranges at $E_{\text {lab }}=234 \mathrm{MeV}$. One can see that in the total distribution and symmetric masses $M=124-132 \mathrm{u}$ there is a high energy component in the TKE, similar to that at $E_{\mathrm{lab}}=211$ and $218 \mathrm{MeV}$, but with a lower yield. It becomes noticeable only at a higher TKE $>245 \mathrm{MeV}$, at a lower TKE it is covered by the main "dome" of the LDM fission. For more asymmetric mass regions $M_{L} \leqslant 120$ u the TKE distributions have a simple one-humped structure. To study the origin of the peak in the variance $\sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2}(M)$ we also applied the following method (Fig. 14): the two-dimensional matrix (TKE, $M$ ) was divided into various TKE regions, then the MED characteristics, namely, mass yield, $\langle\mathrm{TKE}\rangle(M)$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2}(M)$ were analyzed for

the selected TKE ranges. It is seen that the peak in the variance disappears in the case of events with TKE $<230 \mathrm{MeV}$. It means that events with TKE $\geqslant 230 \mathrm{MeV}$ account for the peak in the variance $\sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2}(M)$ in the symmetric mass region. Thus, on the whole, the properties of fission of ${ }^{256} \mathrm{No}$ at $E_{\text {lab }}=234 \mathrm{MeV}\left(E^{*}=35.1 \mathrm{MeV}\right.$, respectively $)$, are close to those of the liquid drop fission for mass range $M=100-156 \mathrm{u}$, but there are some structural features typical of the low-energy fission.

Let us analyze qualitatively the observed picture. If one proceeds from a traditional assumption on the proportionality of the fragment charge and mass, then for the mass region $M_{H}=131-$ $135 \mathrm{u}$ the charge of heavy fragment $Z_{H}=52-54$ and the neutron number $N_{H}=79-81$. So $Z_{H}$ is slightly greater than the magic number $Z=50$, whereas $N_{H}$ is slightly less than the magic number $N=82$. For the complementary light fragments with masses $M_{L}=121-125$, the charge $Z_{L}=48-50$, and the neutron number $N_{L}=73-75$, that is the charge of the light fragment is close to the magic number, but the neutron number is significantly less than the magic number $N=82$. Thus, the SS-mode appears due to the proximity of the nucleon composition both by $N$ and $Z$ to the magic numbers in the heavy fragment, and only by $Z$-in the light fragment. Since the total neutron number is not sufficient for filling spherical shells in both fragments simultaneously, this mode is not dominant in the case of ${ }^{256}$ No and does not manifest itself strongly.

Another interesting peculiarity could be seen in the variance $\sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2}(M)$ from Fig. 14. With a decrease in the TKE values (TKE $<220 \mathrm{MeV}$ and $\mathrm{TKE}<210 \mathrm{MeV}$ ) the peaks in the dependence $\sigma_{\mathrm{TKE}}^{2}$ appear to be more prominent in the mass region of $\mathrm{QF}$ "shoulders" $\left(M_{L}=60-90 \mathrm{u}\right)$ where both $\mathrm{FF}$ and $\mathrm{QF}$ processes coexist.

Our measurement shows that the SS-mode appears in the fission of ${ }^{256}$ No at excitation energies of up to $42 \mathrm{MeV}$. It may seem strange that shell effects still appear at so high excitation energies. According to theoretical estimations [56,57] the fission barrier for ${ }^{256}$ No is $E_{\mathrm{f}}=6.4-$ $8 \mathrm{MeV}$. It was shown in works $[58,59]$ that the fission barrier for ${ }^{254} \mathrm{No}$, produced in the reaction ${ }^{208} \mathrm{~Pb}\left({ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}, 2 n\right)$ at the nucleus spin from $12 \hbar$ to $22 \hbar$ was $E_{\mathrm{f}} \geqslant 5 \mathrm{MeV}$. It means that in our
case, i.e., the fission of ${ }^{256} \mathrm{No}$, the excitation energy in the saddle point is $E_{\mathrm{sp}}^{*}=10-12 \mathrm{MeV}$ for $E_{\text {lab }}=211 \mathrm{MeV}$; and $E_{\mathrm{sp}}^{*}=22-24 \mathrm{MeV}$ for $E_{\text {lab }}=234 \mathrm{MeV}$ with taking into account 0.8 prefission neutrons. That is why the real excitation energy at the formation of fission fragments turns out to be rather low, and the shell effects responsible for the fission valley structure of potential energy surface have an influence on the MEDs of fragments, which is reflected in their structural features seen from Figs. 4, 5, 13 and 14.

Thus, the shell effect manifestation was observed in the MED of ${ }^{256}$ No at a moderate excitation energy. The SS mode decreases with an increase in the excitation energy from $2.5 \%$ for $E^{*}=17.2 \mathrm{MeV}$ to $0.3 \%$ at $E^{*}=35.1 \mathrm{MeV}$ for the nearly symmetric range of fragment masses $M=A_{\mathrm{CN}} / 2 \pm 4$.

## 5. Conclusion

Mass-energy distributions and capture-fission cross sections of the fragments were measured in the reaction ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}+{ }^{208} \mathrm{~Pb} \rightarrow{ }^{256} \mathrm{No}$ at the ${ }^{48} \mathrm{Ca}$ projectile energies of $206-242 \mathrm{MeV}$ using a double-arm time-of-flight spectrometer CORSET.

It was found that MEDs of fission-like fragments consisted of two parts, corresponding to the classical fusion-fission process of the compound nucleus ${ }^{256}$ No with a symmetric mass division, and the quasi-fission "shoulders" with the light fragment masses $M_{L} \approx 60-90 \mathrm{u}$. It was also demonstrated that the observed properties of the fission-like fragment MEDs satisfied formally a hypothesis on the existence of two independent fission modes, only in this case these are the classical FF and QF processes.

The QF shoulders have a higher TKE by $7-15 \mathrm{MeV}$ as compared with that expected for the FF process. We came to a conclusion that the spherical shells $Z=28$ and $N=50$ played a significant role in QF of the ${ }^{256}$ No.

The analysis of the MEDs at $E_{\text {lab }}=220-234 \mathrm{MeV}$ shows that the symmetric fission properties in the mass range $100<M<156$ are close to these in the classical fusion-fission process described by the LDM. However, there are some structural peculiarities in the MEDs caused by the shell effects. The high-energy Super-Short mode was revealed in the region of heavy fragment masses $M_{H}=130-135 \mathrm{u}$. The minimal yield of this mode is $\approx 2.5 \%$ at the energy $E_{\text {lab }}=211 \mathrm{MeV}$ and it decreases to $\approx 0.3 \%$ at $234 \mathrm{MeV}$.
