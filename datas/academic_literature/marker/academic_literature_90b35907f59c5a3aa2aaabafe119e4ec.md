Current treatment for APS is only partially effective and new therapies are strongly needed.

We report on a case of a 50 years old man with APS who suffered from recurrent thromboembolic episodes despite conventional anticoagulant treatment. Eight years after the first thrombotic manifestation he was diagnosed with a large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) plus rituximab was started with partial clinical remission of lymphoma and normalization of aPL levels with a three years follow-up period free of thrombotic episodes.

A review of the literature revealed that only 12 case reports on the use of rituximab in patients with primary, secondary and catastrophic APS have been published. Current knowledge clearly suggests the need for clinical trials to evaluate the effect of rituximab in the treatment of resistant APS. *Lupus* (2008) 17, 50–55.

## Introduction

The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by arterial and venous thrombosis, recurrent fetal loss and persistently positive serum antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL).1 A
life-threatening form of APS, named catastrophic APS (CAPS) is due to a widespread thrombotic process and may present with multiple organ failure.

APS may develop independently of any underlying disease (primary APS or PAPS), in association with autoimmune diseases, mainly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or malignancies (secondary APS or SAPS).

Some authors have reported the efficacy of chemotherapy including rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against CD20 widely used in

To date similar evidences in the treatment of APS are limited and mainly anecdotal.

## Methods

Lupus anticoagulant was determined by the Kaolinclotting time (KCT) and a dilute Russel viper venom time (dRVVT). The anticardiolipin (aCL) IgG and IgM
antibodies and the anti-2-Glycoprotein I antibodies were determined by solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (GA, generic assays GmBH, Germany).

Each episode of deep venous thrombosis (DVT)
was proven with venous compression ultrasonography or angiography. Noncompressibility of a previously normalized venous segment and enlargement of Effect of rituximab on antiphospholipid syndrome GL Erre et al.

thrombus thickness (- or  2 mm) were considered diagnostic of proximal DVT recurrence. Pulmonary embolisms were confirmed by scintigram/ventilationperfusion scan and/or thorax CT scan.

## Case Report

The patient, a 50-year-old man, was previously known with a diagnosis of primary APS. In 1995, he was urgently admitted to our hospital for a left common iliac DVT and acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) were elevated and lupus anticoagulant (LAC) was demonstrated in the serum of the patient on two different occasions. Thus a diagnosis of PAPS according to the international consensus criteria (Sapporo)3 was made.

Lifelong anticoagulant therapy with a moderate intensity warfarin (target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0–3.0) was started but, despite treatment, three further episodes of DVT occurred. In 2002 a new episode of PE supervened and an inferior vena cava filter was placed.

In 2003, he was admitted to our institute for fatigue, fever and upper abdominal pain radiating to the interscapular region. Physical examination revealed severe splenomegaly and axillary lymphoadenopathy.

Laboratory investigations confirmed positivity for aPL (aCL, LAC and anti-2GPI antibodies) and showed positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA 1:160) and anti-double stranded DNA antibodies.

An abdominal Doppler ultrasonography revealed a considerable enlargement of the spleen and multiple focal lesions while angiography showed thrombosis of the splenic vein. Working diagnosis included lymphoma and multiple splenic infarcts. Splenectomy was not performed because the risks for perioperative thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications were felt to be very high.

An axillary lymph node excision showed histology consistent with large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma while staging bone marrow biopsy was negative. Chest X-ray demonstrated multiple pulmonary nodules prompting an extensive work-up with whole body CT
scan and gallium scintigraphy for stadiation of lymphoma that confirmed pulmonary localization of lymphoproliferative disease (stage IV). Because of persistent headaches the patient underwent brain MRI and partial thrombosis of the left transverse cerebral sinus was demonstrated. On the basis of clinical, instrumental and laboratory evidences a diagnosis of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and primary APS was made in this patient.

After obtaining informed consent, chemotherapy including CHOP (cyclophosphamide (Cyc), doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) plus rituximab was started.

Rituximab was scheduled at a dose of 375 mg/m2 every three weeks for a total of six doses. Rituximab was well tolerated with the exception of a transitory hypotension during the first infusion.

After four infusions the patient developed a complete thrombosis of the left femoral vein and a partial thrombosis of the left iliac vein. After the sixth dose of rituximab aPL levels dramatically fell (Figure 1 and Table 1) and no further thromboembolic episodes occurred during follow-up.

The administration of rituximab allowed achieving a partial clinical remission of lymphoma. Unfortunately in 2006 the patient experienced a recurrence of pulmonary lymphoma detected by surveillance CT and positron emission tomography (PET). He finally died from acute respiratory failure due to extensive lymphomatous pulmonary involvement. An autopsy was not carried out.

## Literature Review And Discussion

We searched the Medline database (from 1995, year of

![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png) introduction of rituximab MeSH term, to April 2007) to determine the effect of rituximab on aPL levels, thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia in patient affected by primary APS, secondary APS and catastrophic APS. We use the following MeSH terms alone or in combination: rituximab, APS, aPL, LAC, anticardiolipin antibody, DVT, pulmonary embolism, stroke and SLE. We further reviewed reference lists. The search was limited to article in English.

We found 12 case reports published so far (Table 2).

No controlled trials have been published, limiting Effect of rituximab on antiphospholipid syndrome GL Erre et al.

current evidence to anecdotal cases, an obvious cause of publication bias due to the exclusion of cases in which treatment with rituximab failed to produce clinical improvement. Thrombocytopenia is a common laboratory manifestation of APS and in patients affected with SLE is frequently related to the presence of aPL. In patients with severe thrombocytopenia and high risk for bleeding, various immunosuppressive treatments are demonstrated to be effective in improving platelet count. However, a not negligible percentage of patients become resistant to immunosuppression and splenectomy cannot be performed because of high risk of bleeding and thrombotic episodes. In these patients, a rational for the use of rituximab can be based on its effect on reducing aPL levels which are in turn postulated to be responsible for platelet destruction by binding platelet membrane.

Trappe and co-workers4 demonstrated a close correlation between aCL title reduction and platelets count improvement in a patient with primary APS treated with rituximab for thrombocytopenia refractory to conventional therapies and similar encouraging results were obtained by other authors.5,6 Ames *et al.*7 reported only a partial effect of rituximab on platelets count consistent with evidence coming from larger trials that demonstrated inefficacy of rituximab in about a half of adult patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).8,9 Patients with primary or secondary APS can develop during the course of disease isolated autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AHA) or an association of AHA and ITP.

Haemolysis may be due to a premature erythrocyte sequestration and destruction by a pathogenic mechanism similar to that suggested for immune thrombocytopenia.

Erdozain *et al.*10 demonstrated resolution of refractory AHA in a patient with primary APS following treatment with standard dose of rituximab and, it is interesting to note the lowering effect of this drug on the levels of IgM aCL that decreased from 600 MPL to 100 MPL consistent with data reported by Tomietto *et al.*5 in patient with SLE and secondary APS.

This temporal association is very intriguing in supporting a role of antibody reduction on improvement of clinical related manifestations, although the hypothesis that the two phenomenons are merely associated cannot be surely refuted.

On the other hand some authors failed to demonstrate a persistent reduction of aPL4,5,11 this might be due to the fact that rituximab does not affect long-lived plasma cells12 acting mainly on B cell leaving lymph node germinal centre.

Arterial and venous thromboses are the clinical hallmarks of APS and guide therapeutic choice. Gold standard for the treatment of venous thrombosis and stroke is an indefinite anticoagulation13 but in spite of a seemingly adequate therapy in some patient vessel thrombosis and associated embolism tend to recur. Different immunosuppressants, plasma exchange or i.v. immunoglobulins have been used as rescue therapy particularly in patients with life-threatening thrombotic events and in the catastrophic APS.

Prompted by a lack of efficacy with previous standard and conventional treatment several authors4,6,14,15 observed a dramatic resolution of recurrent and/or severe thrombotic episodes in patients with APS following rituximab introduction. A variable follow-up free of thromboembolic manifestations ranging from 10 to 36 months has been reported.

This finding, if validated from large clinical trials, could have favourable implications mainly for the treatment of catastrophic APS as reported by Rubenstein *et al.*6 Concomitant immunosuppressors such as cyclosporine A5 or plasmapheresis11 treatment, might influence overall effect of rituximab.

In this regard our protocol included Cyc, so one could think that effect on aPL and clinical features of APS may partially be attributed to chemotherapy. Previous authors reported inefficacy of conventional CHOP regimen2 on improvement of APS-related hypercoagulable state, therefore suggesting a prominent role of anti-CD20 on the induction of this effect.

On the other hand Leandro *et al.*16 reported a major clinical improvement in patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis when Cyc was added to rituximab.

Most authors used rituximab weekly for four weeks and in some cases a further infusion at three monthly intervals. We administered rituximab at three weekly intervals and for a total of six infusions.

Interestingly, in this regard, we did not obtain clinical and serological remission (a further episode of DVT occurred and only a partial reduction of aPL titers was obtained) of APS after the first four doses possibly due to the fact that we did not reach a complete B cell depletion. Unfortunately this hypothesis cannot be supported by B cell plasmatic levels because of the retrospective nature of this case report.

Prospective studies are needed to evaluate efficacy and safety of rituximab alone or in combination with other immunosuppressants and address the issues related to the optimal regimen of persistent B cell depletion achieved by maintenance therapy in these patients.

## Conclusions

The case we described and our analysis of the literature are encouraging with regard to the efficacy of rituximab on controlling clinical features of APS and lowering aPL level. Current evidence is only limited to anecdotal cases and randomized controlled trials in patients with APS resistant to the standard therapeutic approach are strongly needed.
