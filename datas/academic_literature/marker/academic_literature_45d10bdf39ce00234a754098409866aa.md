# The Determinants Of Solvency In The United Kingdom Life Insurance Market

## Yung-Ming Shiu

Department of Finance, Tunghai University, Taiwan E-mail: yungming@mail.thu.edu.tw This paper examines the solvency determinants, including economic and firm-specific factors, in the United Kingdom life insurance market. Using panel data for 1986–1999, it is found that solvency was positively related to bonds-to-total assets, equities-to-total assets, and level of new business, but negatively related to unexpected inflation, market competition, assets held to cover linked liabilities-to-total assets, life and general annuity reserves-to-total reserves, pension reserves-to-total reserves, permanent health reserves-to-total reserves, other reserves-to-total reserves, firm size, and insurance leverage. Based on panel data for the three subperiods, 1986–1990, 1990–1994, and 1994–1999, it was further found that solvency determinants changed from one epoch to another.

## I. Introduction

Solvency surveillance has been one of the most important responsibilities of insurance regulators.

With a view to protecting policyholders from the consequences of insolvency of the insurer, many mechanisms such as the US Insurance Regulatory Information System and Financial Analysis and Surveillance Tracking System, have been developed to identify insurers of high insolvency risk. However, relatively little research has been conducted to empirically investigate the factors affecting the financial position of the insurer, especially within the UK context. Although the insurer insolvency rate in the UK has been low during the past two decades, it does not necessarily mean that the solvency of firms is high. In fact, UK life offices have been in a low solvency environment over recent years. This highlights the importance of identifying solvency determinants.

The main contributions of this paper are the following. First, a comprehensive research on solvency determinants using both statutory returns and economic data has not yet been conducted in the UK life insurance industry. Therefore, this study can be used to fill the gap in the literature.

Second, the paper investigates whether solvency determinants are the same across periods and contributes to the existing body of literature that has examined various aspects of insurer solvency.

Third, this paper investigates the relationship between solvency and a number of factors, such as level of new business and termination ratio, which have not yet been used in previous studies. Fourth, the study provides insights into the factors affecting the financial strength of UK life offices. By focusing on the UK life insurance industry, this study is able to control for cross-country and cross-industry differences in regulations. Fifth, the use of panel data models helps overcome some of the data and research method-based limitations such as inability to control for unobservable differences across individual insurers that might influence insurer solvency. Therefore, this research is of value to actuaries, company executives and insurance regulatory authorities.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

In Section II, we briefly discuss the previous literature on the determinants of solvency and performance.

Section III presents theoretical considerations of model building. Section IV describes the data and Section V presents empirical results. The final section concludes the paper and draws some policy implications.

## Ii. Literature Review

Previous studies have shown that a range of marketrelated economic and firm-specific factors may have an impact on life insurer solvency. In a study examining the relationship between economic predictors and insolvencies, Browne et al. (1999) find that lifehealth insurer insolvencies are statistically positively related to market competition. Moreover, Browne et al. (2001) report that life insurer performance is positively correlated to bond returns and negatively correlated to unexpected inflation. Adams and Buckle (2003) investigate the operational performance determinants in the Bermuda insurance market. They find that leverage has a highly significant positive effect on performance and that performance is negatively related to underwriting risk and liquidity. The studies discussed above generally attempt to identify the firm-specific factors and those exogenous to individual insurance firms.

As is evident, none of these studies examined the determinants of solvency of UK life insurers. The aims of this research are to find out which factors affected insurer solvency and to investigate whether these factors changed from one epoch to another.

## Iii. Research Design And Variables

This study employs ordinary least squares regression analysis and two panel data models (one-factor fixedeffects and random-effects models) to test the relation between an insurer's solvency and a number of variables predicted to affect the insurer's financial position. The ordinary least regression model is actually a simplification of the one-factor fixed-effects model.

The fixed-effects panel design allows the intercept to vary cross-sectionally. We can capture the potential influence of omitted variables and control for unobservable interinsurer differences that might have an impact on solvency. If the true effects are random, however, the use of a fixed-effects model may lead to inefficient estimates. For the randomeffects model, it is assumed that the individual unit effects are uncorrelated with the explanatory variables. The random-effects model is believed to be more appealing if the sample is drawn from a large population and the researcher intends to extend his or her inference with respect to characteristics of the sampled individual units to the whole population in question. The one-factor fixed-effects and random-effects models were estimated by partitioned ordinary least squares without overall constant and feasible two-step generalised least squares respectively (Greene, 2002), using LIMDEP (Version 8.0).

The measure of the insurer's solvency is free asset ratio, which is one of the universally recognized solvency measures in the industry. Defining Xit to be the observable variables representing factors for insurer i at time t affecting solvency for firm i at time t, the empirical framework proposed in the study takes the following form:

$$y_{i t}=\alpha_{i}+X_{k i t}\beta_{k}+\varepsilon_{i t}$$
yit ¼ i þ Xkit-k þ "it ð1Þ
where i is the index of company, k is the index of explanatory variables, t is the index of time periods, i and -k are parameters to be estimated, and "it is the error component for company i at time t and is assumed to have mean zero, E["it] ¼ 0 and constant variance E["
2 it] ¼ 2e .

The choice of explanatory variables is based on their theoretical relationship with the dependent variable. The following variables are hypothesized to have an effect on the insurer's level of solvency.

A list of all variables and their definitions is found in Table 1.

## Iv. The Data

Annual statutory returns data were obtained for 311 life offices from 1986 through 1999 from SynThesys Life (Version 3.32), while the data on the economic variables were taken from Datastream. The returns data are unbalanced, meaning that data were not available for some insurers for the 14-year period. During the whole sample period, the industry underwent boom, recession and recovery, which were broadly represented by the three subperiods 1986–1990, 1990–1994, and 1995–1999. In the panel data sets, there are 2054 insurer-year observations over 14 years, whereas 773, 716, and 856 observations for the three subperiods respectively. Summary statistics for the variables for the whole period and three subperiods are found in Table 2.

problem in the analysis. Therefore, we estimated the models using White's heteroscedasticity corrected covariance matrix to derive heteroscedasticityconsistent estimates. In addition, due to the collinearity of regressors the fixed-effects models could not be estimated for the three subperiods, and accordingly Hausman tests could not be employed.

The empirical results separately for the whole sample period 1986–1999 and three subperiods are shown in Table 3. Since the observations come from many cross-section companies, but the time periods are relatively limited, heteroscedasticity is a potential

F-tests for the overall statistical goodness-of-fit of the empirical models are all significant at the 0.001 level, confirming that the fitted models are better than a null model without explanatory variables. The adjusted R2 values range from 0.40 to 0.56. The results of LM and Hausman tests are presented at the bottom of Table 3, suggesting the most appropriate models are all one-factor random-effects models.

To simplify the exposition, the 1986–1999 results for each variable statistically significant, at least, at the 0.05 level will be discussed, and so will the associated results for the three subperiods. The free asset ratio was positively related to bonds-to-total assets, equities-to-total assets, and level of new business, while free asset ratio was negatively related to unexpected inflation, market competition, assets held to cover linked liabilities-to-total assets, life and general annuity reserves-to-total reserves, pension reservesto-total reserves, permanent health reserves-to-total reserves, other reserves-to-total reserves, firm size, and insurance leverage.

The estimates of bonds-to-total assets, equitiesto-total assets were positive and significant in all periods, suggesting that both bond and equity holdings are important factors in determining insurer solvency. The coefficients on level of new business were positive and significant in the 14-year period, 1986–1999, in 1986–1990 and 1994–1999, but insignificant in 1990–1994. This implies that over the longer term and in the boom and recovery years, life insurers acquiring more new business enjoyed higher solvency than those life offices acquiring less new business.

The estimates of unexpected inflation were mixed.

In 1990–1994 and 1994–1999, the estimates were not significantly different from zero. However, over the entire 14-year period and in 1986–1990, the estimates were negative and significant. These results suggest that in the longer term and during the boom years of the late 1980s, unexpected high inflation adversely affected firm solvency because real returns on assets were reduced. The coefficient estimates of market competition were found to be negatively and significantly related to solvency in the longer term and in the recovery of the late 1990s. This finding is consistent with that of Browne et al. (1999) who argue that increased competition contributes to an increase in the probability of insolvency. This is possibly because market competition generally involves inappropriate price-cutting and insurer solvency may be

impaired. The estimates of assets held to cover linked liabilities-to-total assets were negative and significant in all periods, suggesting that the solvency of the life office with more assets held to cover linked liabilities was lower than that of the firm with less. As expected, the free asset ratio was negatively and significantly related to reserves-related variables in most of the models. By definition, the higher the reserve the lower the free asset ratio. Contrary to our expectations, the coefficients on the firm size variable were negative and significant in all periods. These results provide support for the view of Warner (1977) that smaller firms have higher financial distress costs than larger ones, and therefore small firms have stronger incentives to keep solvency high. Finally, the coefficients on the variable representing an insurer's insurance leverage also were negative and significant in all periods, supporting the hypothesis that a life office with excess leverage is relatively likely to become insolvent.

## Vi. Conclusions

Using 1986–1999 data, this article empirically identified the solvency determinants in the UK life insurance industry. From the results presented in the previous section, we conclude that solvency determinants changed from one epoch to another. The results arising out of a specific period may reflect the features of that period. This is the case especially during a time of rapid changes in the insurance market place.

Overall, the results suggest that both economic and firm-specific variables may affect insurer solvency. A number of variables have been identified and discussed. These variables are regarded as determinants of life insurer solvency. When monitoring insurer solvency insurance regulators should pay particular attention to these determinants due to their importance in determining solvency.

The findings have, at least, two implications for the life insurance industry. The first is that life offices have to evaluate their exposure to unexpected inflation risk and insurance leverage risk, and pay attention to their asset allocation and reserves management. The second implication is that insights into the negative relation between solvency and market competition could help industry regulators and policy-makers to frame licensing regulations that limit the number of insurers. These implications may be helpful for those involved in monitoring insurer solvency.
