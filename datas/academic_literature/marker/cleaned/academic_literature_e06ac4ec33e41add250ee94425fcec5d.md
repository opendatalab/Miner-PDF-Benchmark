Belarussian National Technical University, pr. F. Skoriny 65, Minsk, 220013 Belarus e-mail: egolubtsova@tut.by Received March 26, 2004; in final form, June 30, 2004 Abstract—Based on the principle of maximum bond energy, a structural model is proposed for Si3N4 +
60 wt % MoSi2 + 5 wt % Y2O3 + 1.5 wt % Al2O3 ceramics. In this model, Si3N4 clusters form a star-like structure with columnar pores 0.45 and 1.5 nm in size. The smaller pores are filled with MoSi2 molecules, and the larger pores are filled with Y2O3 and Al2O3 clusters. The solubility of MoSi2 molecules in silicon nitride is 70 wt %, and those of Y2O3 and Al2O3 are 5.45 wt %. The energies of intercluster interaction in two mutually perpendicular directions are 3.2 and 5.5 eV, which is comparable to bond energies in structural metallic materials. The lattice parameters of molybdenum disilicide are determined by x-ray diffraction. The formation of MoO3 and SiO2 molecules during thermal cycling has an insignificant effect on the structure of the material.

## Introduction

Structural ceramic materials possess high mechanical strength and fracture toughness in combination with enhanced thermal stability, hardness, wear resistance, oxidation stability, and corrosion resistance and low density [1]. The use of such ceramics is, however, limited by their inherent brittleness and insufficient thermal-shock resistance, difficulties in mechanical and thermal treatment, and the lack of simple, reproducible fabrication processes [1].

The ability to improve the physicochemical properties of nanoceramic materials depends crucially on precise knowledge of the underlying interactions at the atomic, molecular, and cluster levels and the optimization of the fabrication process.

## Analysis Of Theoretical Approaches

The intraatomic, intramolecular, and intercluster interactions in ceramic materials can be understood in terms of a two-particle quantum-mechanical model, which allows one not only to clarify the adhesion mechanism but also to optimize the technology of highstrength coatings [2].

Pair interaction can be represented by a convergent series of the form

$$E_{\mathrm{b}}\,=\,\sum_{n\,=\,1}^{\infty}{\frac{a_{n}}{r^{n}}}.$$
$$\left(1\right)$$

The n = 1 term describes interaction between point charges, which is responsible for covalent and ionic bonding. At n = 2, the bonding is due to the interaction between point charges and dipoles. This type of bonding occurs if at least one of the interacting particles has an intrinsic electric moment. This is characteristic of atoms in which one valence electron has an elongated orbit and interacts with excited electrons which have spherical orbits or more elongated orbits (S - P, P - D,
and other, analogous configurations). The n = 3 term
(third approximation) represents dipole–dipole interaction, which occurs primarily in ionic crystals. Higher order terms were left out of consideration because their contribution to the bond energy is insignificant.

The formation of nanoclusters was analyzed theoretically in [3]. The principle of maximum (in magnitude) bond energy suggests that the formation of complex molecules involves several steps. The first to form are radicals—two-component molecules with free chemical bonds. Next, the free chemical bonds become saturated via interaction of the molecules with one another and the attachment of other atoms (molecules)
to the resultant multiatomic structure. The process continues until all of the chemical bonds of the original atomic structures are saturated. Based on the proposed mechanism of the formation of complex molecules, consider, as an example, the molecular structures that are used in producing nitride ceramics with tailored electrical properties: Si3N4 , MoSi2 , Y2O3 , and Al2O3 .

Silicon nitride exists in two polymorphs: α-Si3N4
(low temperatures) and β-Si3N4 (high temperatures).

The two modifications have hexagonal structures. The lattice parameters of α-Si3N4 are a = 0.7818 nm and c = 0.5591 nm, and those of β-Si3N4 are a = 0.7595 nm and c = 0.29023 nm [1]. The α β transition is irreversible [4].

The main structural component of silicon nitride is an SiN4 tetrahedron. The structure of Si3N4 is made up of groups of three tetrahedra which share a nitrogen atom and are 120° apart. The structures of α- and β-Si3N4 differ in the stacking of the tetrahedra along the c axis.

0020-1685/05/4102- © 2005 Pleiades Publishing, Inc. 0140 2 The best sintering aid for silicon nitride is a mixture of Y2O3 and Al2O3 , which ensures the formation of a Y−Si–Al–O–N liquid phase and, accordingly, efficient densification of silicon nitride [4]. At 1400°ë, Y2O3 and Al2O3 react with the SiO2 layer on the surface of Si3N4 particles to form a eutectic melt, in line with the SiO2–Y2O3–Al2O3 phase diagram. This process ensures densification of the material. At the same temperature, the α β transformation of Si3N4 begins [5, 6].

Silicon nitride is a dielectric material. Conducting additives, such as TiN, MoSi2 , TaC, and La2CrO3 impart metallic properties to Si3N4 ceramics, which extends their application field.

Figure 1 schematically illustrates the formation of Si3N4 molecules. In the α form, the three silicon atoms and two nitrogen atoms form a symmetrical structure.

In the β-form, the symmetry is distorted, and the structure is not tetragonal (Fig. 1c).

The structure of silicon nitride in the basal plane is shown schematically in Fig. 2. The main clusters are separated by columnar pores, which form a pore structure.

The minimum pore size is close to the diameter of the Si3N4 molecule (0.67 nm). The bond energy is determined by the dipole–dipole interaction. In the basal plane, the bond energy for the main clusters is 1.4 eV. The resultant bond energy is 3.2 eV. In the vertical direction, the potential energy of the electric dipoles is 0.461 eV, and the resultant bond energy is 5.532 eV. Therefore, β-Si3N4 is comparable in bond energy to metals.

MoSi2 , A2O3 , and Y2O3 have simple cubic structures, characteristic of ionic crystals. With allowance made for the repulsion from the second neighbors, the bond energy in the cluster structure of MoSi2 is 1.136 eV. Those in the molecular structures of Al2O3 and Y2O3 are 1.344 and 0.611 eV, respectively. The cluster structures of MoSi2 , Al2O3 , and Y2O3 molecules must break up at 1923, 2325, and 908°C, respectively.

The simple cubic structures characteristic of ionic crystals are rather loose. Each cluster is surrounded by four columnar pores of diameter ( - 1)dcl, where dcl is the diameter of the main cluster.

Silicon nitride has a rather loose, cluster structure
(Fig. 3) and, accordingly, low mechanical strength. An applied mechanical load gives rise to screw shear strain, which may eventually cause alignment of electric moments and an explosive structure breakdown. One way of preventing this is by filling the intercluster pores. The filler must have a large electric moment, and the size of its main cluster must slightly exceed the pore diameter. The former condition ensures strong dipole– dipole coupling in a certain position in the pore, and the latter leads to lattice distortions, which markedly reduce the screw shear strain under an applied load.

Cluster structures may contain pores of various sizes. Small pores may be filled with individual molecules, and large pores, with clusters. The main clusters







in the structure of Y2O3 have the weakest bonds and are likely to sit in the large pores in the structure of silicon nitride, forming a close packing. The main clusters of MoSi2 are also large enough to fill the pores in Si3N4













almost entirely. Since the cluster structure of Al2O3 breaks up at relatively high temperatures, large alumina particles may fill only those pores associated with structural defects in silicon nitride. Accordingly, the starting mixture for the preparation of Si3N4 ceramics typically contains only 1.5 wt % Al2O3 . The cluster structure of Al2O3 degrades notably at relatively high temperatures, and its main clusters may fill large columnar pores in silicon nitride. This conclusion is supported by the results reported by Rigel *et al.* [5]: the Al2O3 solubility in Si3N4 is 67 mol % at 1750°C and 78 mol % at 1850°C. These data fit well with the decomposition temperature of the cluster structure of Al2O3 (2325°C).

To fill all of the large columnar pores in Si3N4 , the amount of Y2O3 in the starting mixture must be 5.45 wt %. According to experimental data, the optimal Y2O3 content of Si3N4 ceramics is about 5 wt % [4],
which is 0.45 wt % lower than the theoretically predicted value.

It follows from the structure of the main cluster in MoSi2 that MoSi2 will fill small columnar pores and that the electric moments of its molecules will be arranged in series. As a result of shear strain, molecules with antiparallel electric moments will have a new arrangement of their electric moments and will fill small columnar pores. Thus, for each columnar structure filled with MoSi2 with a certain direction of its electric moment there are two columnar pores with an opposite direction of electric dipoles.

The interaction between the electric moments of MoSi2 in the small columnar pores enhances the strength of the cluster structure of silicon nitride. The additional cohesion energy in the cluster structure of silicon nitride is 0.088 eV per main cluster. The resultant bond energy of the molecules in the main cluster of silicon nitride is 2.86 eV.

Each main cluster in the structure of Si3N4 is surrounded by three small columnar pores. Given the difference in size between the MoSi2 and Si3N4 molecules, the necessary amount of MoSi2 is 70 wt %. There is

no need for high temperatures: all of the small columnar pores can be filled with MoSi2 molecules under the action of relatively weak consecutive thermal shocks.

Heating to relatively high temperatures leads to catalytic decomposition of MoSi2 into MoSi and Si. The interaction between an Si atom and Si3N4 molecule leads to decomposition of the latter. As a result, four SiN dipole molecules and one MoSi dipole molecule are formed. Thus, the resulting material has ionic bonding and, hence, is a typical dielectric.

## Experimental And Results

Based on the above observations, we developed a process for the fabrication of ceramics, which were then characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and microstructural analysis. As the starting materials, we used UBE-SN-E-10 Si3N4 powder (KOKUSHI, Japan);
yttrium acetate Y(CH3COOH)3 · 4 ç2é (Johnson Mattey, Germany); aluminum isopropoxide Al(OC3H7)3, 98% (Johnson Mattey); and MoSi2 (Starck, Germany).

The flow chart of the preparation of Si3N4 + 5 wt %
Y2O3 + 1.5 wt % Al2O3 mixtures is shown in Fig. 4.

Molybdenum disilicide was ground to a particle size of 0.8–1.4 µm. After addition of the Si3N4-based mixture (MoSi2 : mixture = 1 : 3 to 1 : 10), the powder was thoroughly mixed by grinding. The compaction and sintering procedures were similar to those described in [7]. The sintered bodies were subjected to multiple thermal cycles in the range 500–1200°C in a PL
10/12.5 bench-top resistance furnace, followed by holding in the furnace for 5 min and cooling to room temperature in air. The structure and phase composition of the resultant ceramics were examined by XRD.

XRD patterns were collected on a Siemens D-500 and DRON-3 diffractometers (CuKα radiation, graphite monochromator, continuous scan rate of 2°(2θ)/min).

The phases present were identified using an application program.

instead of reaction (2). The same is evidenced by XRD
data after thermal cycling to 1200°C: the XRD pattern shows peaks from MoSi2 and Mo5Si3 . The microstructure of the sample after thermal cycling to 1200°C is shown in Fig. 10.

The lattice parameters of MoSi2 were determined by the formulas

where λ is the x-ray wavelength, h1k1l1 and h2k2l2 are the Miller indices of two diffraction peaks from the phase of interest, and θ1 and θ2 are the respective Bragg angles. We used the 213 (θ1 = 75.68°) and 116 (θ2 =
85.70°) reactions from MoSi2 .

The data in the table demonstrate that thermal cycling has an insignificant effect on the lattice parameters of MoSi2 (experimental uncertainty of 1 and <1%
for the samples with initial particle sizes of 0.483 and 0.583 µm, respectively). The obvious reason is that the atomic radius of oxygen (0.0665 nm) is substantially smaller than those of silicon (0.133 nm) and molybdenum (0.079 nm) [9]; accordingly, the forming MoO3 and SiO2 molecules produce insignificant lattice distortions in molybdenum disilicide.

The lattice strain arising in molybdenum disilicide owing to the formation of MoO3 was assessed from the width B of the 116 peak, which was determined with an accuracy of 2.5% and <5% for the samples with an average particle size of 0.483 and 0.851 µm, respectively. Independent of the MoSi2 content, raising the temperature from 500 to 1200°C slightly increased the lattice strain on account of the thermal expansion mismatch between the constituents of the material. This effect was more pronounced at 60 wt % MoSi2 .

The XRD pattern of the as-sintered sample shows reflections from molybdenum disilicide and silicon nitride (Fig. 5). The strongest peak from SiO2 , 110, has a very low intensity. In a certain temperature range, MoSi2 may chemisorb oxygen to form a molybdenum oxide. At 500°C, the peaks from SiO2 grow considerably, and peaks from MoO3 emerge, attesting to oxidation of molybdenum disilicide [8]:

$$2\mathrm{MoSi}_{2}+7\mathrm{O}_{2}\longrightarrow2\mathrm{MoO}_{3}+4\mathrm{SiO}_{2}.$$

Figures 8–10 display the microstructure of the sample before and after heat treatment. The loose layer on the sample surface consists of MoO3 .

According to Kurokawa *et al.* [8], above 750°C,
MoO3 is not the main product of MoSi2 oxidation in air.

The process is dominated by reaction
