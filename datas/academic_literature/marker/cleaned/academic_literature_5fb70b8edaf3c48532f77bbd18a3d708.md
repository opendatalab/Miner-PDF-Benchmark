# Dose-Response Relationship Between Tobacco Consumption And Melanin Pigmentation In The Attached Gingiva

The dose-response relationship between tobacco consumption and melanin pigmentation in the attached gingiva was examined on two occasions 4 yr apart in a group of Japanese lead workers with blood lead concentrations below 2.0 ILmol/kg (40 JLg/100 g). 

In the two examinations, 12% and 18% of the total group of workers and 17% and 24% of the smokers had melanin pigmentation. The prevalence of pigmentation was significantly higher in smokers who inhaled more than 10 cigarettes per day (17% and 25%) than in nonsmokers (0% and 2%), and tended to increase significantly with tobacco consumption. Lead absorption, however, was not associated with melanin pigmentation. 

MELANIN PIGMENTATION in the attached gingiva among tobacco smokers, i.e., "smokers' melanosis," 
was first described in white Europeans by Hedin, 1 and was noted among Japanese by one of the present authors. 2 Histologically, in this condition, melanin is deposited in the basal layer of the epithelium without evidence of malignancy. 

1 Pigmentation of the gingiva is often found among American Negroes, 3 black Africans, 4 native Australians, 5 and Greenland Eskimos. 

6 Heavy metal intoxication 
(e.g. , " classical" lead poisoning), Yusho disease (PCB 
poisoning), and some serious systemic illnesses also can cause various types of gingival pigmentation. 7•
8 Among Japanese, it was reported in 1928 that 32% of the people who visited or were admitted to hospitals had pigmentation of the oral mucosa and that 56% of those with the pigmentation were smokers; 9 another Japanese report noted that the prevalence of pigmentation was 5%.

10 According to a recent study, 62 of 94 cases of malignant melanoma in the oral cavity were associated with pigmentation of the gingiva and other oral mucosa.

11 It should be especially noted that 34 cases were preceded by the pigmentation, to which the name of "precancerous melanosis" was given. 11 In this study, we evaluate a dose-response relationship between tobacco consumption and the gingival pigmentation in a group of Japanese lead workers. 



Evaluation of these workers was conducted twice at 4-yr intervals, during which blood lead concentrations decreased among the workers owing to the improvement in their working environments. 

## Subjects And Methods

All subjects (N = 195) were male lead workers 
(stereotype and type founders, type-pickers, typesetters, and paper molders), who were constantly employed in a newspaper company for a total of 8 yr 
(i.e., 1972-1979). A periodic statutory medical examination was commenced in 1972 in this company with measurements of blood lead concentrations and other indicators of lead absorption. 12 Concerted efforts to reduce environmental lead exposure were introduced at workplaces in 1973; that effort was followed by a gradual decrease in workers' blood lead concentrations. 

Examination of melanin pigmentation in the attached gingiva, together with collection of data on tobacco consumption and blood lead concentrations, was conducted at the annual medical examinations in April of 1975 and 1979. Reliable data were obtained from a total of 154 and 165 workers (79% and 85%, respectively) each year. They had suffered from neither heavy metal poisoning nor Yusho disease. 

The presence of melanin pigmentation in the attached gingiva of the mandible and maxilla on the labial side of the canines and incisors was assessed each year by two of the present authors. Any solitary or diffuse brownish black pigmentation within the epithelium of the attached gingiva, which corresponded to degrees I-IV of pigmentation in Hedin's classification, 1 was counted as pigmentation. Figure 1 a shows diffuse pigmentation in front of the canines and incisors, both in the mandible and maxilla, in a 36-yr-old lead worker who smoked 20 cigarettes per day for 18 yr. Histologically, deposition of melanin pigment was observed in the basal layer of the epithelium; no lead sulfide was detected (Fig. 1 b). 

Blood lead concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Perkin-Elmer 403) with wet ashing, chelation by ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and water-saturated methyl isobutyl ketone. 13 "Normal" blood lead concentrations in this company are assumed to be 0.4 ± 0.1 (mean ± standard deviation) ILmol/kg (8 ± 2 JLg/100 g). 12 Fisher's exact test was applied for the comparison of two proportions when an observed count (number of persons) was five or less in one or more categories. The chi-square test was used when the observed count was more than five in all categories. 

## Results

The prevalence of gingival pigmentation in 1975 is shown in Table 1 in relation to tobacco consumption history and blood lead concentrations. Among 154 workers examined, 19 (12%) were found to have melanin pigmentation in the attached gingiva. The number of workers with pigmentation corresponded to 17% of the 113 workers who smoked cigarettes. The pigmentation rate was significantly higher in smokers who smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day (17%) 
than in nonsmokers (0%); the rate tended to increase in proportion to tobacco consumption. Conversely, the pigmentation rate was not significantly associated with blood lead concentrations. 

The same trend was observed in 1979 (Table 2). The prevalence of pigmentation (18% of the total group examined and 24% of the smokers) remained high in spite of a decrease in blood lead concentrations. There was no significant difference in pigmentation rates between 1975 and 1979 (P > .05). 

## Discussion

This is probably the first report which discloses a dose-response relationship between tobacco consump-

tion and prevalence of gingival pigmentation. Evidence for a causal relationship between tobacco smoking and pigmentation is strengthened by this study. 

The pigmentation rate was significantly higher in smokers who smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day than in nonsmokers; the average duration of smoking was more than 14 yr (Table 1). Analyses of the effect of smoking duration on the pigmentation rate and on its reversibility would be required to determine more precisely the dose-response relationship. 

The following findings indicate that lead absorption does not cause melanin pigmentation in the attached gingiva below the blood lead concentration of 2.0 
~tmol/kg (40 J.tg/1 00 g). 

(1) No significant difference in the pigmentation rate was found between the three blood lead levels examined. 

(2) The pigmentation rate remained unchanged in spite of a decrease in blood lead concentrations over 4 yr of observation. In fact, the rate minimally, though not significantly, increased during this period, probably because most smokers continued to smoke during the period. 

(3) Macroscopic (and microscopic) findings in the pigmented gingiva did not coincide with those typical of the lead line in "classical" lead poisoning. The lead line can be observed along the margin of the gingiva and is characterized by distribution of lead sulfide granules in the blood vessel walls and the connective tissue papillae. 14 The pigmentation rate among the Japanese in this study was close to that reported previously among white Europeans in Sweden (13% and 15%). 1 Therefore, it is suggested that no substantial racial difference exists between Japanese and Europeans in the pigmentation rate. The rate is assumed to be determined by smoking rates. 

A possible effect of nicotine on the melanin-containing cells in the gingiva, as well as in the inner ear, has been suggested to be the cause of "smokers' melanosis." 1 Further studies are required to clarify the mechanism underlying the development of this type of melanosis. Similarly, follow-up studies are necessary to determine whether this apparently benign melanosis can develop into malignant melanoma or other oral malignancy.
