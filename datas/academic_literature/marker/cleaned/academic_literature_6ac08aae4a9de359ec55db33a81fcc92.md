10−2 wt %) or carbon (≤5.8 × 10–3 wt %) are measured, and the parameters of impurity-related absorption bands and extinction coefficients are determined. The effects of oxygen, carbon, sulfur, and hydrogen on the transmission of As2Se3 glass are analyzed. At an oxygen content on the order of 10–5 wt %, this impurity causes optical losses in the range 900–1100 cm–1 comparable to the intrinsic losses. The permissible carbon content of As2Se3 glass is 10–6 to 10–5 wt %. Carbon inclusions 0.07 µm in diameter cause optical losses comparable to the intrinsic losses in the spectral window of As2Se3 glass when present in a concentration of ~104 cm–3.

## Introduction Experimental

The mid-IR transmission of glassy As2Se3 is sensitive to oxygen impurity, which is responsible for IR
absorption bands near the long-wavelength transmission edge. In earlier studies [1–3], the positions of several impurity bands in the transmission spectrum of oxygen-doped As–Se glasses were determined, and some of those bands were identified. Quantitative data on oxygen-related absorption were reported for As2Se3.4 glass [3]. Such data for glass of stoichiometric composition (As2Se3) would allow one to confirm the assignment of impurity bands, to more accurately determine the state of oxygen, and to evaluate the extinction coefficient of the glass.

The effect of carbon impurity on the IR spectra of As–Se glasses has not yet been studied in sufficient detail. Borisevich *et al.* [4] described absorption bands due to carbon compounds in glassy Se. Such data for glassy As2Se3 are not available in the literature. Earlier
[5], experiments on chemical vapor transport of carbon in As2Se3 vapor from a high-temperature to low-temperature zone revealed a restricted carbon solubility in molten arsenic selenide.

The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of oxygen and carbon impurities on the optical transmission of glassy As2Se3 . To this end, we measured the IR transmission spectra of samples containing known levels of oxygen and carbon.

Glassy arsenic selenide was prepared by melting high-purity arsenic and selenium at 800°C in an evacuated quartz tube introduced into a rocking muffle furnace, followed by furnace-cooling (1–3°C/min). The resultant glass ingots were 11 mm in diameter and 160 mm in length. The IR transmission spectra of glass samples up to 15 mm thick showed no impurity absorption bands in the range 350–4000 cm–1. The carbon content of the glass, as determined by reaction gas chromatography, was within 0.2 ppm by weight. The concentration of second-phase inclusions determined by laser ultramicroscopy [5] was 1.6 × 107 cm–3, and their diameter was 0.06–0.10 µm. The metal and silicon contents were determined by optical emission spectroscopy (0.1–1 ppm).

Glass samples containing known amounts of oxygen were prepared as described previously [3]. A glass ingot (with known levels of impurities and secondphase inclusions and a known IR absorption spectrum)
was placed in a quartz tube which was then filled with oxygen to a preset pressure and sealed off. As a result, the tube contained known amounts of arsenic selenide and oxygen gas. The tube was mounted in a furnace and heated to 650°C to homogenize the melt.

As shown earlier [3], the oxygen that was not incorporated into the As2Se3 melt formed cubic As2O3 in the vapor phase. The oxide was condensed at the opposite end of the tube, and its amount was determined gravimetrically. We also prepared a control sample by the same procedure but without introducing oxygen into the tube. The amount of oxygen in the doped samples was evaluated as the difference between the amount of oxygen introduced into the tube and that present in As2O3. In this way, we obtained a series of samples with an oxygen content from 4 × 10–3 to 7.7 × 10–2 wt %. The estimated error of determination was typically within 10%. Analysis of the samples containing 4 × 10–3 to 2.2 × 10–2 wt % O on a laser tandem reflectron mass spectrometer confirmed the calculated oxygen contents, as illustrated in Fig. 1, which compares gravimetry (C1) and mass spectrometry (C2) data.

Carbon was introduced into arsenic selenide as described in [5]. A sample of high-purity glassy As2Se3 was situated in the bottom part of an evacuated quartz tube, and a silica glass crucible containing a graphite (OSCh 7-4) rod was secured in the upper part of the tube. The temperature in the zone of the graphite rod was 900°C, and molten As2Se3 was maintained at 650°C. Carbon and the Se2 molecules resulting from the dissociative As2Se3 vaporization reacted according to the schemes [5]

$$\mathbf{C}(s)+1/2\mathbf{S}\mathbf{e}_{2}(g)\Longleftarrow\mathrm{CSe}(g),$$
$$\mathbf{C}(s)+\operatorname{Se}_{2}(g)\Longleftarrow\operatorname{CSe}_{2}(g).$$

The forward reactions (1) and (2) are endothermic, which ensures vapor transport of carbon from the hightemperature to the low-temperature zone. The reaction time was varied from 4 to 32 h. In a control experiment, run under the same conditions for 8 h, the tube contained no graphite. After air cooling, the glass samples were analyzed for total carbon and submicron-sized second-phase inclusions.

In optical studies, we used plane-parallel plates 1 to 10 mm thick, with their faces polished to optical finish. Transmission spectra were measured in the range 350–
5000 cm–1 in vacuum with a Bruker IFS-113v Fourier transform IR spectrometer and were then converted into absorption spectra with allowance made for the sample thickness. The homogeneity of the impurity distribution was checked by measuring the IR absorption spectra of samples cut from the upper and lower portions of the ingot. The spectra showed no variations in absorption with position in the ingot.

## Experimental Results

1400 cm–1) of oxygen-doped As2Se3 glass samples in comparison with the control sample.

vapor transport. The IR absorption spectra of the carbon-doped and control samples are displayed in Fig. 3.

## Discussion

The IR absorption spectra in Figs. 2 and 3 clearly demonstrate that doping with oxygen and carbon reduces the IR transmission of the glass (compared to both the parent glass and control samples). Oxygen doping gives rise to prominent absorption bands in the range 400–1400 cm–1, and carbon doping produces additional bands in the range 850–1700 cm–1.

Here, I(ν) is the integrated intensity of a composite band, Ik(ν) is the integrated intensity of the kth symmetrical band, and n is the number of symmetrical bands.

The bands were fitted by Voigt line shapes,

where ν0 is the peak-absorption frequency, I0(ν0) is the peak intensity of the band, and C and E are parameters The intensity (absorption coefficient) was determined with an accuracy of 7–10%.

The results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The width and shape of the individual components were independent of impurity content, as were their peak positions (to within 3–5 cm–1).

The set of impurity bands in the oxygen-doped As2Se3 glass differed very little from that in the

   2005 Se-enriched glass As2Se3.4 [3]. For most of the impurity bands, the peak position, assignment, and other parameters were the same in the spectra of the two glasses.

The only distinction was that the weak feature at 904 cm–1, which was assigned earlier to the Se–O
bonds in glassy As2Se3.4 , was lacking in the present spectra.

Figure 4 illustrates two types of variations of the impurity absorption coefficient with total oxygen content in As2Se3 glass. At oxygen levels above 1.5 ×
10−2 wt %, we obtain straight lines for the bands due to absorption in glassy As2O3 (by AsO3 /2 structural units)
(e.g., the bands at 503, 805, 633, and 650 cm–1), as in an earlier study [3]. The intensity of the bands due to As4O6 molecules (e.g., those peaked at 482 and 790 cm−1) ceases to increase between 4.0 × 10–2 and 4.8 × 10–2 wt % O. The extinction coefficients for each of the impurity bands were determined from the linear portions of the plots and are close to the data for glassy As2Se3.4 (Table 4). These data refer to the total oxygen content of the glass, rather than to particular species, and give, therefore, effective extinction coefficients.

The assignment of the impurity bands and the observed variation of the absorption coefficient with oxygen content (deviation from the Lambert–Beer law) can be accounted for by the presence of a few oxide species in the glass [3]. In the range 1.5 × 10–2 to 7.7 ×
10–2 wt % O, these are AsO3/2 groups, forming the glass network of arsenic oxide, and As4O6 molecules. At oxygen contents below 1.5 × 10–2 wt % (the concentration range which was not studied in [3]), the variation of the absorption coefficient with oxygen content deviates from linearity. Two types of such variations are illustrated in Fig. 5 for the strongest bands (650 and 790 cm–1). As seen in Fig. 5, our results agree well with the data obtained by Moynihan *et al.* [2], who reported that, at low oxygen levels in As2Se3 glass, oxygen was present mainly in the form of As4O6 molecules (oxide species I) and oxygen atoms substituting for Se in the As2Se3 glass network (oxide species II). Species I and II are responsible for the absorptions at 790 and 650 cm–1, respectively. The other bands observed in this concentration range can be divided into two groups according to the variation in their intensity. One group comprises the bands at 482, 503, 805, 937, 995, 1050, 1265, and 1340 cm–1, attributable to species I. This assignment is supported by the fact that the IR spectrum of arsenolite, consisting of As4O6 molecules, shows bands close in frequency to those above: 480, 500, 800–
805, 938, 985, 1050, and 1265 cm–1 [7–10]. The other group includes the bands at 965 and 1125 cm–1, arising from species II. Their frequencies correspond to the absorption bands of glassy As2O3 [8, 10].

The observed variation of the absorption coefficient with total oxygen content suggests that the relative amounts of oxide species also depend on oxygen con-





tent. Below 1.5 × 10–2 wt % O, isolated oxygen atoms incorporated into the glass network and dissolved As4O6 molecules prevail. At higher oxygen levels, structural components of glassy arsenic oxide appear:

That the intensity of the As4O6-related bands ceases to grow (Fig. 4) suggests that this species is an intermediate product of polymerization. Changes in the relative amounts of oxide species are also evidenced by the observed shifts

of composite bands. In particular, increasing the oxygen content of the glass shifts the band at 650 cm–1 to 635 cm–1 (Fig. 2) owing to the increase in the intensity of the 633-cm–1 component compared to the 650-cm–1 component. Similarly, the 950-cm–1 band shifts to 940 cm–1 with increasing oxygen content (Fig. 2).

These findings provide clear evidence that the relative amounts of oxide species in As2Se3 glass depend on the total oxygen content.

It follows from the data in Table 1 that chemical vapor transport of carbon in the form of CSe or CSe2 can be used as a process for the introduction of carbon into molten arsenic selenide since the total carbon content increases by more than one order of magnitude compared to both the parent glass and control sample.

Carbon is present in As2Se3 in several forms, including submicron-sized second-phase inclusions. Their concentration in doped samples is an order of magnitude higher than that in the parent glass and control sample and increases with reaction time. In addition, some of the second-phase inclusions may consist of silica, as suggested by the higher silicon content (by a factor of 2.5) and higher concentration of inclusions in the control sample compared to the parent glass (Table 1). We also observe an increase in absorption in the range 900–
1100 cm–1 (Fig. 3), where bands due to Si–O vibrations may appear [11]. It seems likely, however, that most particles consist primarily of carbon. The particle concentration in the control sample differs from that in the sample held in the presence of a graphite rod for the same time (Table 1, samples 2, 6) by almost a factor of 7, indicating that the main contribution to the formation of foreign particles in the melt comes from the reaction between selenium vapor and carbon, followed by CSe and CSe2 decomposition in the low-temperature zone [5]. Our results also indicate that carbon solubility in molten As2Se3 at 650°C is no higher than 10–3 wt %.

The preparation of glass samples with a relatively high carbon content, up to 5.8 × 10–3 wt %, made it possible to reveal selective absorption bands in their IR
spectra. By unfolding composite bands, we were able to identify individual components and determine their parameters (Table 3). The components at 895 and 1275 cm–1 are assignable to C–Se vibrations given that the spectrum of carbon diselenide contains bands centered at 902 and 1275 cm–1. The other absorptions are most likely due to C–C bonds.

The extinction coefficients for individual carbonrelated absorptions are difficult to evaluate from the present data because the relative amounts of carboncontaining species, necessary for such evaluation, are unknown. The nonuniqueness of the relationship between the total carbon content and band intensities in the spectra of doped samples indicates that the predominant carbon-containing species is determined not only by reactions (1) and (2). Nevertheless, the present results can be used to estimate the carbon content leading to a preset level of optical losses in the spectral window of glassy As2Se3 . The optical losses through the scattering and absorption by carbon inclusions in As2Se3 glass were evaluated using earlier data on the spectral characteristics of soot particles close in carbon content to 100% [12]. In the peak-transmission range of As2Se3 glass (5–6 µm), the additional losses will not exceed the intrinsic losses at a concentration of



0.07-µm particles below 104 cm–3. The concentration of larger sized particles must be even lower. Calculations from the spectra of samples 2 and 5 in Fig. 3, which show the highest impurity absorption level, give the following estimates for the extinction coefficient of carbon impurity: 6 × 103 and 1.3 × 104 dB/(m wt %) in the range 1250–1700 cm–1 and 7 × 103 and 2.8 × 104 dB/(m wt %) in the range 850–1150 cm–1 for samples 2 and 5, respectively. In this spectral region, the loss level comparable to the intrinsic losses in glassy As2Se3 can be reached at carbon contents from 10–6 to 10–5 wt %.

Figure 6 shows the spectral dependences of the extinction coefficient for oxygen, hydrogen (Se–H
bonds), and sulfur impurities in As2Se3 glass. As seen, oxygen and sulfur impurities have a significant effect on the long-wavelength transmission of the glass, while hydrogen influences its short-wavelength transmission. Using quantitative impurity absorption data, one can evaluate the permissible impurity concentrations in As2Se3 glass with a preset optical loss level. For example, the oxygen-related losses will not exceed the intrinsic loss level in the CO2 lasing range (900–1100 cm–1)
at oxygen contents in glassy As2Se3 within 10–5 wt %.

The results of such calculations can be used to formulate requirements on the purity of glassy arsenic selenide for optical fibers.

## Conclusions

Oxygen impurities are present in As2Se3 glass in the form of several species: As4O6 molecules, polymeric glassy arsenic oxide, and isolated oxygen atoms substituting for Se in the glass network.

The relative amounts of these species and, accordingly, the relative intensities of the corresponding IR
absorption bands depend on the total oxygen content.

Carbon impurities are present in the form of atomic groups, which give rise to selective absorption bands in the range 850–1700 cm–1, and second-phase inclusions, which increase the scattering and absorption losses.

It follows from the present results that, at oxygen and carbon contents below 10–6 to 10–5 wt %, these impurities have an insignificant effect on the optical transmission of glassy As2Se3 .
