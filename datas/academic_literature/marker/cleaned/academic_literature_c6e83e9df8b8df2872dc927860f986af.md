# Disparity Between Visual Fields And Optical Coherence Tomography In Hydroxychloroquine Retinopathy

Michael F. Marmor, MD,1 Ronald B. Melles, MD2 Purpose: American Academy of Ophthalmology recommendations for screening for hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ) retinopathy advise objective measures, such as spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)
and multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) along with visual fields. However, the relative sensitivity and speci-ficity of screening tests have not been fully resolved. We characterize a subset of patients with toxicity who show unusual disparity between fields and SD-OCT and thus have implications for screening practice.

Design: Review of charts and clinical data.

Participants: Patients at Stanford and Kaiser Permanente who had used HCQ with greater than 1000 g cumulative exposure. There were more than 2000 such individuals, among whom 150 had clear evidence of toxicity.

Methods: Patients were evaluated by visual fields (10-2 white Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm pattern deviation plots), SD-OCT, and sometimes mfERG or fundus autofluorescence.

Main Outcome Measures: Relative findings on visual fields in comparison with SD-OCT.

Results: There were 11 patients among those with HCQ toxicity who had parafoveal ring scotomas but a normal-appearing SD-OCT. None had a history of macular disease or evidence for any other cause of bull's eye maculopathy. Conversely, all cases with a clear degree of parafoveal damage on SD-OCT showed at least some focal spots of parafoveal field loss.

Conclusions: Approximately 10% of patients with early HCQ toxicity showed prominent ring scotomas on field testing without obvious SD-OCT abnormality. This should encourage the inclusion of visual fields as a key screening tool, even when SD-OCT (a more specific and objective test) also is performed. The combination of visual fields and SD-OCT gives both sensitivity and specificity while avoiding unnecessary stoppage of the drug.

The availability of sensitive objective measures of retinal function and structure has changed attitudes toward screening for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinopathy. Hydroxychloroquine retinopathy is thought to be infrequent but of increasing prevalence because patients use the drug for many years or have undue exposure from overdosage or renal failure.1 Screening in previous decades was primarily by subjective functional measures, such as the central visual field. Multifocal electroretinography (mfERG), spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) add sensitive objective data that can confirm suspicions from a borderline visual field or show anatomic damage before there is any visible "classic" bull's eye retinopathy.2,3 Recent recommendations from the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) emphasized the importance of adding objective tests and the rationale for recognizing this toxicity early to prevent visual loss.4 However, there is no agreement in the literature on which screening test for HCQ toxicity is the most sensitive and specific. Some have argued for fields, FAF, mfERG, or SDOCT, or suggested that patients may differ in their apparent sensitivity to different tests.3 Of course, clinical tests
(subjective or objective) are only as good as the quality of the equipment and the experience and sensitivity of the readers. The argument over "Which comes first: a change in structure or function?" has some theoretic validity, but the answer may well vary with different mechanisms of cellular damage and with the relative sensitivity of tests that are available.

Our purpose in this report is not to resolve this issue but to document a subset of patients with HCQ toxicity who show pathognomonic visual field loss without any obvious structural damage on SD-OCT. These examples do not prove that fields are the "most" sensitive screening test, because some patients are not good field takers and many other patients show early SD-OCT changes, but they emphasize the need for taking a broad approach to the evaluation of this retinal toxicity, recognizing the danger of relying on any single procedure, and using confirmatory tests when any results are less than definitive.

## Methods

The data are derived from chart reviews of patients with HCQ retinopathy at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford and the Kaiser Permanente health system in California. The procedures were approved by institutional review boards at both institutions and adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The Ophthalmology Volume -, Number -, Month 2014

patients at Stanford were all under the care of MFM in the past



10 years, during which approximately 20 toxic cases were recognized (all referrals). The patients at Kaiser were part of a larger retrospective study, in which all patients who had taken a cumulative dose of HCQ greater than 1000 g between 1993 and 2013 were reviewed (2289 patients).

Marmor and Melles - Fields and OCT in Hydroxychloroquine Retinopathy



Toxicity was found in 150 of these patients with a high-risk dosage history, as determined by clear parafoveal scotomas between approximately 2 and 6 degrees on 10-2 fields or clear parafoveal thinning and damage on SD-OCT in the same parafoveal region, along with other confirmatory data when available, including fundus images, mfERG, and FAF.

Only pattern deviation plots from white 10-2 Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm fields are used for this analysis, because few patients had red fields, and white pattern deviation has been shown to be a sensitive and reliable indicator of HCQ
toxicity.5 Field testing used the Humphrey perimeter (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Spectral-domain OCT cross-sections were read by both authors to confirm agreement on discrete parafoveal thinning or changes of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) or interdigitation zone (IZ) on at least 1 side of the fovea (these terms are equivalent to inner/outer segment line and cone outer segment tip line, respectively).6 These are subjective judgments (except where normalized thickness data are available), but SD-OCT changes were accepted as an indication of toxicity only when considered clearly abnormal in a typical region, and beyond image variability, by both authors. Patients at Stanford had SD-OCT with the Zeiss Cirrus device (Carl Zeiss Meditec), and patients at Kaiser had SDOCT with the Heidelberg device (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). Normalized thickness Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts were available only with the Zeiss Cirrus. The 2 patients at Stanford had mfERG studies. Multifocal ERG was recorded according to international standards,7 using VERIS instrumentation (Electro-Diagnostic Imaging, Redwood City, CA), with 103 stimulus hexagons.

## Results

We found a number of cases with prominent parafoveal ring scotomas that were strongly indicative of retinopathy despite a seemingly normal SD-OCT. To avoid arbitrary designation of how extensive a scotoma must be to qualify as "clearly toxic," we present only the most demonstrative cases (11) that showed relatively complete ring scotomas. All of these patients were at high risk for toxicity (the demographics and dosages are listed in Table 1). None had a history of macular disease, and we had no reason to postulate other causes of bull's eye maculopathy.

Figure 1 shows the bilateral visual fields (10-2 pattern deviation plots) and horizontal SD-OCT cross-sections from 5 of these patients (cases 1e5). For all 11 patients, the fields were basically symmetric in showing a parafoveal ring scotoma, and there was no obvious SD-OCT damage in either eye. Some readers might suspect very subtle thickness or EZ or IZ line changes in the parafovea in a few cross-sections, but these are tracings that would pass for normal on first review by many ophthalmologists and certainly do not show obvious damage as do the visual fields.

line. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study cube shows normal values in all regions. The fundus and auto-fluorescence images are normal (some shadow artifacts on the latter, but no evidence of toxicity). However, functional measures document toxicity. The pattern-deviation plot shows a partial ring scotoma in the parafovea, and a 10-2 red target field shows a more obvious 360 scotoma. This patient also had an mfERG that shows central macular dysfunction with lowest signals in the parafovea.

We also surveyed our patient base to see whether any subjects with toxicity had the converse findings of clear SD-OCT damage in the presence of normal fields. Although there were many cases with both early field loss and early SD-OCT damage, there were no cases in our population with prominent parafoveal anatomic damage and no field changes at all. Figure 3 shows a case with distinct parafoveal thinning, but field losses that are spotty and might be dismissed as normal (or at least left for later confirmation). This patient had taken 6.5 mg/kg/day (ideal weight) of HCQ for 10 years and had a cumulative dose of 1460 g. Both vertical and horizontal OCT cross-sections are shown, demonstrating parafoveal thinning and loss of EZ and IZ
lines. The fundus image was normal, and the autofluorescence showed mild patchy hyperfluorescence of unclear significance.

The pattern deviation field plot shows only a single spot of parafoveal loss with high significance, and an mfERG from this patient was suggestive but not definitive in showing parafoveal loss
(ring ratio analysis8 was normal).

## Discussion

The visual fields in these cases showed prominent ring scotomas typical of HCQ toxicity, whereas the SD-OCT crosssections showed no obvious abnormality. Given that other cases had less complete, but nonetheless convincing, visual field defects in the absence of SD-OCT abnormality, we judge that approximately 10% of our toxic cases show this disparity between fields and SD-OCT. This finding seems to argue that fields are more sensitive than SD-OCT for detecting early toxicity and that fields may be a sufficient test for screening. These are fair points, although we would argue for a different message. Fields are indeed more sensitive in some patients, and the use of SD-OCT alone would miss early detection in cases such as we have presented. However, approximately 90% of our toxic cases did not show this disparity, and some of these show only subtle field loss
(Fig 3) while the SD-OCT is clearly abnormal. Thus, SDOCT remains a powerful, sensitive, and objective screening tool, as emphasized in the AAO guidelines.4 The presence of parafoveal thinning or line break-up (EZ or IZ) on SDOCT was always associated with field loss and thus was always specific for toxicity. Furthermore, early field changes are sometimes missed or dismissed by less experienced readers, and many patients are not good field-takers and may not show reliable early field changes.

We have reported results primarily with white 10-2 pattern deviation plots. Although red fields can be sensitive to toxicity, white pattern deviation plots are more specific for showing toxic damage.5,9,10 The cases in this report were selected on the basis of prominent ring scotomas, but the earliest recognizable field changes in pattern deviation plots may be only a couple of isolated parafoveal spots (Fig 3).3 This is a pattern that ophthalmologists should learn to recognize, just like arcuate scotomas or nasal steps in glaucoma.11 However, because very early damage may overlap nonpathologic variations, we suggest that ambiguous changes should trigger (1) repeat testing to see whether the patterns of loss are consistent or (2) the addition of objective testing such as SD-OCT and mfERG.

The latter provides the equivalent of an objective visual field and is especially useful to verify early or unreliable field changes.

Fields may be sufficient for initial screening where SDOCT is not available, and SD-OCT change is unlikely if a reliable field shows no losses at all. However, the use of both tests will provide more comprehensive screening to recognize early toxicity and confirm toxicity, as recommended in the AAO guidelines.4 The mfERG is an alternative objective test to assess early retinopathy, but it is not as readily available (or as easy to reliably perform) as the SD-OCT and was not recorded for most of our patients, so we discuss primarily the importance of SD-OCT testing.

Hydroxychloroquine is a valuable drug with low systemic toxicity and should not be stopped casually for mere hints of damage. We typically like to verify early toxic changes with 2 independent tests before making a recommendation to stop. The pace of toxic damage seems slow enough that there is time to perform additional or repeat tests when there is ambiguity, and this is preferable to stopping the drug unnecessarily.

Fifty percent of our cases were receiving daily dosage more than the recommended 6.5 mg/kg ideal weight/day, and all patients had more than the 1000 g cumulative dosage reported to signify toxic risk.8 Thus, concerns that duration and overdosage represent risk factors1,3 are supported
(although not proven) by this case series, and we believe it is important that ophthalmologists take the initiative in reminding referring medical physicians of the proper daily dosage.3,11 We are analyzing the prevalence of toxicity relative to demographics, dosage, and risk factors in a separate publication.

Although the OCT cross-sections in all of these cases appeared normal to routine examination, normalized cube thickness measurements that appear on the Zeiss Cirrus OCT instrument (Figs 2 and 3) may add another level of sensitivity.3 Only case 6 of our series was examined with the Cirrus instrument (the others were tested with the Heidelberg instrument), and we cannot rule out the possibility that some others might have shown early parafoveal cube thinning that was not obvious in the crosssections. Our series reinforces the need to be aware that different patients may show different sensitivity to diagnostic tests, which may relate partly to inherent differences in the sensitivity of tests and in pace of functional versus structural change, but partly to issues of patient and physician reliability in performing and reading tests.3,12 Finally, our series reinforces the conclusion that visible fundus changes, which represent RPE damage, are a late finding because none was present in our cases. Fundus examination should not be relied on for screening.3,4,11 In conclusion, approximately 10% of patients screened carefully for HCQ toxicity show prominent ring scotomas on field testing before the SD-OCT is obviously abnormal.

This should encourage the inclusion of 10-2 pattern deviation field testing as a key screening tool, even when SD-OCT
(a more specific and objective test) also is being performed. Visual fields and SD-OCT are both readily available, and the use of both tests, as advised in the AAO recommendations,4 provides a practical combination of sensitivity and specificity for detecting early toxicity, while avoiding unnecessary stoppage of the drug.
