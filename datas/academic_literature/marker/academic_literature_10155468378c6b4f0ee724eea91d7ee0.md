## Abstract

Methylation at arginines has recently come to attention as a posttranslational modification of proteins, which is implicated in processes from signaling, transcriptional activation, to mRNA processing. Here we report that several proteins extracted from HeLa cells were methylated by PRMT1 (protein arginine N-methyltransferease 1) even on a nitrocellulose membrane, while proteins from Escherichia coli are not methylated with this protein. Screening PRMT1 substrates from a Egt11-HeLa cDNA library, we found that more than half of the 48 cDNA clones obtained encode putative RNA-binding proteins that have RGG (arginine - glycine - glycine) motifs, such as hnRNP R (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R) and hnRNP K. We cloned two novel arginine methylation substrates, ZF5 (zinc finger 5) and p137GPI (GPI-anchor protein p137), which do not possess typical RGG motifs. We also cloned a novel protein that has RGG motifs, but does not have any other RNA-binding motifs. We tentatively termed this clone SAMT1 (substrate of arginine methyl transferase 1).

A63-VLD-65 to AAA mutation of PRMT1 suppressed the methylation of recombinant SAMT1 and other RGG proteins in the HeLa extracts.

This systematic screening of substrate proteins with the solid phase methylation reaction will contribute to identify new roles of PRMT
family. D 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

## 1. Introduction

Methylation of arginine residues by covalent modifications occurs in eukaryotic proteins during or shortly following mRNA to protein translation. Evidence for posttranslational methylation of arginine residues was first provided by the presence of radioactive species chromatographing at positions near that of arginine in acid hydrolysates of isolated calf thymus nuclei proteins incubated with [methyl14C]-S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) [1]. The products of the methylation reaction were determined to be NG-monomethylarginine and NG,NG-dimethylarginine [2]. Protein arginine N-methyltransferases (PRMTs) catalyze the sequential transfer of methyl groups from SAM to the guanidino nitrogens of arginine residues within proteins
[3,4]. It now appears that there are at least two distinct classes of protein arginine methyltransferases according to their substrate specificity and reaction products [4]. The type I enzymes catalyze the formation of NG-monomethylarginine and asymmetric NG,NG-dimethylarginine residues, while type II enzymes catalyze the formation of NG-monomethylarginine and symmetric NG,NVG-dimethylarginine.

The asymmetric dimethylarginine appears to be the more common form while symmetric dimethylarginine has so far been identified only in a few proteins, including myelin basic protein (MBP) [5], and spliceosomal Sm proteins D1 and D3 (SmD1 and SmD3) [6]. Reported type I enzymes are the yeast Hmt1p/Rmt1p [7] and the mammalian PRMT1 [8],
PRMT3 [9], and CARM1/PRMT4 [10]. PRMT1 and yeast Hmt1p/Rmt1p prefer to methylate arginine residues in glycine rich regions, which are found in several RNPs, fibrillarin, and nucleolin [11]. However, CARM1/PRMT4 has little or no activity with substrates preferred by these enzymes, and the best substrate reported for CARM1/
PRMT4 is histone H3 [10]. JBP1/PRMT5 can methylate histone H2A and H4 and myelin basic protein (MBP) [11]. Recently, a potential candidate for a type II enzyme, JBP1/
PRMT5, has been discovered in mammalian cells with an apparent homologue in yeast, Hsl7 [12]. Yet, its sequence is well conserved with other family members, the catalytic activity of PRMT2 has not yet been demonstrated [13]. The conservation among protein arginine N-methyltransferases may underscore the potential biological importance of this posttranslational modification. In addition to these, the type III enzyme was also recently discovered in yeast, and this catalyzes the monomethylation of the internal y-guanidino nitrogen atom of arginine residues [14].

PRMT1 knockout mouse has already been established, and the phenotype of the homozygous null mutant is embryonic lethal [15], suggesting that PRMT1 is required for very early stages of mouse development. Though recent evidence has implicated arginine-specific protein methyltransferases in nuclear export of some hnRNP proteins and in several signaling pathways (reviewed in Ref. [4]), specific roles of protein methylation and the relevant protein substrates have not been identified. Because each methyltransferase recognizes a different set of protein substrates, systematic analysis of their substrate specificity is now required for differentiating their function. To this end, we report here a new expression cloning strategy to identify substrate proteins of PRMT1, which is potentially applicable to isolate substrates specific for each member of the PRMT family.

## 2. Materials And Methods 2.1. In Vitro Methylation Reaction

In vitro methylation assay was performed as described by

![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)

Najbauer et al. [16] with a few modifications. One microgram each of recombinant proteins was added in a 20 Al reaction mix containing 50 mM Na-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid [MOPS] (pH 7.2), 300 mM, NaCl, 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF], 0.1 Ag/ml leupeptin and 0.4 AM Sadenosyl-L-[methyl3H] methionine [3H-SAM] (specific activity of 1.3 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences, NJ) with 0.02 - 0.04 Ag/Al recombinant PRMT1 or bovine serum albumin [BSA] (as a negative control) and incubated at 30 jC for 45 min. The methylation reaction was terminated by adding 20 Al sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS] sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Each 20 Al reaction solution was then loaded onto a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and separated by electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie blue R250 to visualize protein bands and then fluorographed, dried and exposed to Kodak film at  80 jC for 2 days.

## 2.2. Solid Phase Methylation Assay

Cell extracts were size-separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [SDS-PAGE] and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then incubated in a reaction mix containing 50 mM Na-MOPS (pH 7.2), 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1 Ag/ml leupeptin, and 0.4 AM 3H-SAM with 1 Ag of recombinant PRMT1 at 30 jC for 1 h, washed with PBS [phosphate-buffered saline]
and TPBS [Tris –phosphate-buffered saline], fluorographed, dried, and exposed to Kodak film at  80 jC for 2 days.

2.3. Screening of a cDNA library by solid-phase methylation The HeLa UNI-ZAP cDNA expression library (Stratagene, CA) was plated on Escherichia coli XL-1 blue strain

at a density of 1.8 × 10 4 plaques per 100 × 140 mm square agar plate. After incubation for 3 h at 42 °C, the plates were overlaid with nitrocellulose membrane filters (PROTRAN,
Schleicher & Schuell, NH) that had been soaked with 10 mM isopropyl- β - thiogalactopyranoside [IPTG]. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for another 4.5–5 h, and their filters were peeled off, immersed in blocking solution
[5% skim milk in PBS] and gently agitated at 4 °C for 1 h.

Fig. 3 (continued).

(BioMax MR-2, Kodak, NY) at  80 jC for 1 week. At the first screening, 607 positive clones were detected in 2.0105 plaques. We picked up 100 of these clones and succeeded to isolate 83 positive clones by the third screening. Positive clones were converted to plasmids with the Exassist/Solr E. coli system (Stratagene).

## 2.4. Northern Hybridization Analysis

SAMT full-length cDNA probe or h-actin probe was labeled with radioactive [a32P] dCTP using the multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). A
human multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech, CA)
membranes were used. Hybridization was carried out at 42 jC overnight in hybridization mixture (6- SSC [1-
SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate], 50%
formamide, 1% SDS, 1 - Denhardt's solution, 10%
dextran sulfate, 100 Ag of denatured salmon sperm DNA
per ml). The membrane was washed three times at room temperature in washing buffer (0.1- SSC, 0.1% SDS),
and the hybridized transcripts were observed with a BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo).

## 2.5. Cell Culture And Transfection Assays

HeLa cells were grown on cover slips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium [DMEM] supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 U/ml streptomycin. Expression vectors of pGFP (Clontech) containing cloned full-length cDNAs were introduced into cells at approximately 60% confluence with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, NY) following the transfection conditions as recommended by the manufacturer.

For immunoflourescence, cells were washed in PBS and fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature, permeabilized, and blocked in PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100, 1.5% BSA, and 5% normal goat serum.

## 3. Results

3.1. Detection of methylated proteins by PRMT1 on a nitrocellulose membrane First we examined whether proteins in HeLa cell extracts could be methylated by PRMT1 on a nitrocellulose membrane. HeLa cells were cultivated for 3 days in the presence of the methyltransferase inhibitor, 20 AM adenosine dialdehyde (AdOX), to prevent endogenous methylation that would mask our assay. Nuclei and cytosolic fractions were then size-separated on SDSPAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with recombinant human PRMT1 and the methylation substrate 3H-SAM at 30 jC for 30 min.

Four major bands and seven minor bands in the nuclei fraction appeared after 2 days exposure (Fig. 1A, lane 3),
whereas four major bands and three minor bands appeared in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1A, lane 4). All these bands were faint or absent in extracts prepared from HeLa cells cultivated without AdOX (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2), suggesting that most arginines in these proteins were already methylated in vivo in HeLa cells. To further examine the validity of the in vitro methylation reaction on the nitrocellulose membrane, we methylated recombinant hnRNP A1 under the control of an IPTG promoter in E. coli. Proteins were isolated from IPTG-treated or
-untreated whole E. coli containing recombinant hnRNAP
A1, separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Methylated proteins were specifically detected in the IPTG-induced E. coli containing hnRNP A1 (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). In E. coli not containing human hnRNP A1, no positive band was found in IPTGtreated E. coli (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). These results show in vitro methylation by PRMT1 is specific to the human protein and that E. coli does not methylate the human protein, at least at the proprietorial arginine residues. These results prompted us to perform a comprehensive substrate screening of PRMT1 using a Egt11-
HeLa cDNA expression library in E. coli host with IPTG-induced cDNA protein products separated on the nitrocellulose membrane.

![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)

(Fig. 2A) and a representative of the first and third screening (Fig. 2B). After the first screening, 607 positive clones were detected in 2.0-105 plaques. We picked up 100 of these clones and succeeded to isolate 83 positive clones by the third screening. We determined the nucleotide sequences of 48 of these clones. A BLAST search
[17] against GeneBank revealed that more than half of the clones encode putative RNA-binding proteins such as hnRNP R, hnRNP K, GRY-RBP (glycine, arginine, and tyrosine-rich RNA binding protein), TAFII68 (TBP associated factor II68), RBP56 (RNA binding protein 56), and TLS/FUS (translocated in liposarcoma), as summarized in Table 1. A common feature of these proteins is to contain RGG motifs at their C-terminus (indicated by stripes in the right end column of Table 1). Eight clones encoded the same novel protein, which also has RGG motifs at its C-terminus, but not other RNA-binding motifs. We termed this clone SAMT1 (substrate of arginine methyltransferase 1). The predicted amino acid sequence of SAMT1 is shown in Fig. 3A. During preparation of this manuscript, a clone named CG1-55 coding the identical protein to SAMT1 was registered to the database of GeneBank, as one of conserved human genes by comparative proteomics [18]. Northern blot analysis of SAMT1 mRNA showed ubiquitous expression in human tissue samples (Fig. 3B). We tagged cloned cDNAs with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and GFP-tagged SAMT1 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm around nucleus, presumably at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
while the other RGG-proteins were localized in the nucleus in HeLa cells (Fig. 4). Other five clones encode a transcription factor, ZF5 (zinc finger 5) and a GPI (glycosyl phosphatidylinositol)-anchor protein, p137GPI. Both of these proteins do not have typical RGG motifs.

## 3.3. Methylation Of Cloned Proteins By Prmt1 In Vitro

To determine whether the cloned proteins are really methylated by PRMT1 in vitro, we prepared recombinant proteins of GST (glutathione sulfatransferase)-ZF5, GSTp137GPI, GST-hnRNP R, GST-GRY-RBP, GST-TAFII68, GST-TLS, and GST-SAMT1 (Fig. 5A). These proteins

were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with recombinant PRMT1 and 3 H-SAM. All of above proteins were highly methylated by PRMT1, while GST alone was not methylated (Fig. 5A). These proteins were methylated when they were incubated with HeLa cell extracts and 3 H-
SAM (Fig. 5C). Next, we tested the effect of a dominantnegative PRMT1 on methylation of HeLa cell extracts. We mutated PRMT1 cDNA by substituting alanines for three amino acids, valine 63 , leucine 64 , and aspartic acid 65 ,
located in the highly conserved region that is proposed to be important for SAM binding and thus for methytlransferase activity [10] (Fig. 5B). The VLD to AAA mutation of PRMT1 abolished the enzymatic ability to methylate hnRNP
Al in vitro (data not shown). Administration of the mutant PRMT1 suppressed the methylation of GST-hnRNP A1, GST-TAFII 68 , and GST-SAMT1 by the extract (Fig. 5C),
suggesting that these proteins are methylated mainly by PRMT1 in the HeLa cell extract.

## 4. Discussion

Protein function is often modulated by posttranslational modifications; phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation, and methylation. Though an important role for protein methylation in bacterial chemotaxis has long been appreciated (reviewed in Ref. [19]), a role of protein methylation in signal transduction has not been explored in mammalian cells with the same breadth and intensity that protein phosphorylation has enjoyed in recent years. Unlike phosphorylation, protein methylation might be irreversible, because protein demethylases have not been discovered so far [20]. Yet, this may be a key mechanism of cell function as a growing number of proteins are being found to contain methylated amino acids, monomethylarginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine. Many of these proteins are associated with RNA, such as the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 [21,22], the U3 small nuclear RNAbinding protein fibrillarin [23], the rRNA binding protein nucleolin [24], poly(A)-binding protein (PAB) II [25], the Src-associated substrate, Sam68 [26], interleukin enhancer binding factor3 [27], and the yeast Npl3 protein [28,29]. As a result, the hnRNPs contain about 65% of the total NG,NGdimethylarginine found in the HeLa cell nucleus [11].

The site of arginine methylation for type I enzymes typically occurs within glycine- and arginine-rich (GAR)
domains from which similar consensus sequences have been derived [4,7,16,30]. A search of the GenPept database for a consensus FGGRGGF motif revealed 13 substrate candidates [16]. Of these, 10 were known or presumed to interact with RNA [16]. In our expression screening, we did not isolate any of 13 candidates, and seven of cloned 9 genes encode hnRNP R, hnRNP K, GRY-RBP, TAFII68, RBP58, TLS/FUS, and SAMT1, respectively, all of which contain the consensus sequence or consensus-like sequences with two to three amino acid substitutions (Table 2). However, the other two do not have the consensus motif. Recently, Smith et al. [25] reported that most of the methylated arginine residues were found in Arg-X amino acid-Arg (RXR) clusters in the C-terminus of PAB2. They showed both PRMT1 and PRMT3 methylated the arginine in the Cterminal domain. As shown in Table 2, ZF5 and p137GPI
contained the RXR sequence, though the methylation sites of these proteins have not been identified yet.

The glycine-rich clusters with many glycine - glycine dipeptides interspersed with aromatic or arginine residues are termed ''RGG'' [31]. The RGG motif is ubiquitous in proteins involved in diverse aspects of RNA metabolism such as pre-rRNA processing factors, pre-mRNA splicing factors, hnRNPs, and RNA helicases [32]. The C-terminal RGG motif of hnRNP U, which lacks RRM (RNA recognition motif), facilitate as the RNA-binding motif [31]. In nucleolin, which has two RRMs, the C-terminal RGG
domain mediates RNA binding even without the RRMs
[31]. However, Bouvet et al. [33] reported that this domain interacts with 10 ribosomal proteins. Likewise, in hnRNP A1, RGG domain is not only involved in interaction with RNA [34] but also with proteins [35]. In spite of prevalence of RNA binding proteins with RGG motifs, few studies have directly addressed the effect of arginine methylation on binding of target proteins to RNA. However, recent studies have examined arginine methylation in modulating protein –

protein interactions (reviewed in Ref. [36]). Asymmetric arginine methylation of Sam68 within the RGG domains decreases Sam68 binding to SH3 proteins but not to WW domain-containing proteins, suggesting that methylation may alter the specific protein –protein contacts [37]. Similarly, methylation of STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) decreases its affinity for its inhibitor PIAS1
[38]. Recently, we screened the factors that interact with the RGG domain of Npl3p with the two hybrid system and isolated nine different genes of which five have RGG domains [39].

Disruption of Hmt1p/Rmt1p in yeast showed that the methyltransferase activity is critical for efficient nuclear transport of the specific hnRNP proteins, Npl3p, and Hrp1p, and is important in RNA metabolism [40]. Npl3p is also modulated by phosphorylation in the arginine/serine (RS)
domain by Sky1p and the phosphorylation influences the shuttling of Npl3p [41,42], indicating the complex regulation of hnRNP proteins with double modulation of arginine methylation and serine phosphorylation. In mammals, mouse embryonic stem cells bearing a null mutation of PRMT1 were viable, though the mouse was embryonic lethal [15]. However, the yeast Hmt1p/Rmt1p deletion strain was viable under standard growth condition [40]. In support of this, transfected HeLa cells with the VLD to AAA
mutant, the dominant-negative PRMT1, expression vector survived and showed normal growth (unpublished data).

Desrosiers and Tanguay [43] and Najbauer et al. [44]
reported that protein methylation is involved in cellular stress responses and the aging/repair of proteins. Considering that PRMT1 is the predominant type I arginine methylase in mammalian cells [9], PRMT1 may be required for specific developmental processes or for stress responses.

Systematic screening of substrate proteins with the solid phase methylation reaction described here will contribute to identify new roles of PRMT family.
