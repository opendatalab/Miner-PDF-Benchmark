# AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE TEACHING OF CURRENT EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE GRADES 

MARY G. KELTY<br>Chicago, Illinois<br>NELLE E. MOORE<br>Supervisor of Elementary Education, Wilmette, Illinois

In the period during and immediately following the World War, great interest was manifested in the teaching of current events in the schools. Many junior and senior high schools experimented with methods and materials in current events and adopted a permanent program, either providing special classes in the subject or providing specific correlation with history, civics, or oral English. Since that time suggestions for the adoption of a similar program in the elementary schools have occasionally been put forward, but as a rule these suggestions have not been given serious consideration. The general feeling seems to have been that children in the middle grades are too immature, their background of information too restricted, and their reading ability too limited to warrant any expectation that they might be able to understand present-day problems.

Here and there a few teachers and principals have undertaken to carry on the study of current events in the middle grades, but after several semesters many of them gave up the attempt, declaring the available materials to be unsuited for the use of young children. Others have continued the study during one reading period a week even though they did not feel fully satisfied with the results. None of them, however, so far as the writers are aware, has consistently measured results or presented evidence as to the children's understanding or interest.

Meanwhile, significant changes have been taking place in education. The results of the great improvement in silent reading are beginning to make themselves felt throughout the entire elementary-
school system, especially in the later middle grades. Children in the fifth and sixth grades are now reading as well as children formerly read some grades in advance. Consequently, the need of new materials is being keenly felt. At the same time there is being attempted in the social sciences a very genuine and widespread reorganization of materials, with the objective of choosing problems and activities in line with social values and life-situations. Educators everywhere are emphasizing the desirability of awakening interests and developing attitudes as early in the child's experience as possible in order that the cumulative force of many years of practice may carry over those interests and attitudes into life after the child leaves the schoolroom. Valuable allies for such an attempt are now furnished by the news reels in the motion-picture houses and by the rotogravure sections of the metropolitan newspapers, both of which are usually available to elementary-school children throughout the country.

Like all other students of the social sciences, the writers have been much concerned with these changes and have been eager to investigate their effects on the ability of middle-grade children to read current events. Most opportunely, an invitation came to them to undertake for a period of two years, ending in June, $193 \mathrm{I}$, the editorship of the only news periodical for middle-grade children then existing, namely, the News-Outline, published by the American Education Press. They accepted the invitation as a challenge to experiment in this untried field, to measure results, and to discover whether those results would warrant any conclusions.

The first problem was the setting-up of an educational program. It was obvious that materials chosen for young children should be subjected to a double test: (I) accuracy and (2) suitability to children's interests and capacities. The experimenters therefore drew up for their own guidance a set of principles and policies, which (with the changes and adaptations suggested by two years of experience) follows.

## Gulding Principles and Policies

r. [Adopted at the end of the first year as a result of following the fourthgrade work.] Most fourth-grade children do not have sufficient command of the reading process nor sufficient background in knowledge of the world to enable them to read a current-events paper with profit.

2. A complete résumé of the news of the world is unsuited to the interests and capacities of children in the fifth and sixth grades. Topics should be carefully selected, and only a few should be presented at one time.
3. A variety of interests should be built up-political, geographical, economic, mechanical, artistic, scientific, etc. Foreign news should be included as well as domestic news.
4. In each issue the leading article should dwell at some length on an important phase of world-news. It should carry with it the necessary explanation for building up a rich background of understanding. A few other short articles (perhaps two to four) may deal with other selected topics.
5. When feasible, the leading articles may well alternate foreign and domestic news. They should also attempt to present successively news of a predominantly political, historical, geographic, economic, and social nature.
6. In order that continuity of treatment may be secured, the shorter articles should usually include a follow-up treatment of a topic which has formerly constituted a leading article.
7. Material which is merely interesting reading does not justify its appearance in a current-events paper. The items included should serve materially to introduce children to important problems of present-day institutions.
8. Inasmuch as most schools will devote only one reading period a week to current events, the amount of material in one issue should probably be measured by the possibilities of this half-hour a week.
9. Since middle-grade children are not careful readers of the newspapers produced for adults, the factor of importance of a news item should outweigh the factor of exact timeliness.

ro. Children's information can be tested. Their interest in the materials, however, can best be judged by their classroom teachers.

## THE CONDUCTING OF THE EXPERIMENT

From the outset the experiment faced a serious disadvantage in the physical makeup of the paper. The fact that the sheet was only $5^{\frac{1}{2}}$ by $8 \frac{1}{2}$ inches in size necessitated the use of very small type and seriously impaired the value of the few pictures that could be included. The results secured were attained in spite of the unattractive appearance of the paper. Teachers were helped to make the reading more interesting, however, by a sheet on "Teaching Current Events," which was sent out at the beginning of the first year.

Each weekly issue contained a leading article, from two to four shorter articles, and an entire page devoted to tests and activities in various forms. The tests were informal objective tests based on the leading article. The "activities" suggested things to do to awaken interest and to develop understanding.

All the first year was devoted by the experimenters to practice in choosing and adapting materials for fifth- and sixth-grade children. ${ }^{\mathrm{x}}$ They also followed the reactions of several groups of children to the differing types of materials that were presented week by week. At the beginning of the second year the writers felt that the testing program might be inaugurated. Through the co-operation of the publishers the names of 35 teachers teaching 992 children in 17 states were secured. These teachers expressed their willingness to administer the weekly tests, record their results on a tabulation sheet furnished them, and send in a report at nine-week intervals. Other teachers reported for one, two, or three terms but did not serve during the entire year. These schools represented large cities, villages, and rural areas, and both public and parochial organizations. The publishers also generously co-operated in printing and mailing the record sheets.

In addition to a tabulation of the test results, the teachers were asked to furnish the following information.

THE FINDINGS

In order that the reader may understand the type of currentevents material used in the study, the titles of the front-page stories are given in Table I. The classifications into political, historical, geographical, economic, and social have been made according to the particular interpretation of the news given in the story.

A summary of the pupils' first, second, and third choices of stories in each of the four nine-week periods appears in Table II. Nine stories of domestic news ranked first, second, or third in the choices of these pupils, while six stories of foreign news received such rankings. Seven of the favorite stories are classified as political and historical, five are classified as geographical, and three as economic and social. The choices of these children seem to indicate that fifth-grade and sixth-grade pupils are interested in both foreign and domestic news

and that they have greater interest in the important phases of worldnews than has been commonly believed by teachers and school administrators.

Table III shows the types of illustrations used with the stories which the pupils liked best. Thirty-five stories were voted on. Eight of the thirty-five had no front-page illustrations. Some significance may be attached to the fact that fourteen of the fifteen stories voted as first, second, or third choices had front-page illustrations.

While this study secured no data as to the attractiveness of the paper from the point of view of size of the page and the size of type, the experimenters feel that the need for a larger and more attractive paper is imperative. A larger paper with larger type would, of course, cost much more than the middle-grade current-events paper now available, and no commercial firm can be expected to put such a paper on the market unless the schools can support the enterprise. The publication of such a paper would appear to be a project worth subsidizing by a foundation interested in education.

An attempt was made to measure the difficulty of each selection through objective tests-true-false, multiple-choice, completion, and completion of outlines. A comparison of the ranks of stories according to the ease of reading as shown by these tests and the ranks ac-

cording to choices shows little or no relation between choices and ease of reading. However, the scores of the pupils on all the objective tests were sufficiently high to indicate that the stories had been comprehended by a majority of the pupils. Since the highest scores were consistently made on the true-false and the multiple-choice types of tests, the conclusion seems warranted that the scores were determined by the form of the test and not by the ease of reading the stories. Table IV shows the comparative ease of reading the stories as revealed by the comprehension tests.

The replies to the question asking whether the pupils' families take daily or weekly newspapers show that approximately 85 per cent of the families represented in the study take daily papers and that between 60 per cent and 70 per cent take weekly papers. Teachers reported that about 50 per cent of the pupils gave evidence of reading newspapers by bringing pictures to school and by reporting additional information to the class.

Thirty teachers reported on the suitability of the material as to language difficulties. Of these thirty, twenty-seven had found the language suitable, and three reported the language of a few stories to be too difficult.

Fifty-one votes out of fifty-four indicated that the quantity of material in the News Outline was sufficient to serve the needs of teachers of fifth and sixth grades.

## CONCLUSIONS

The data seem to justify the following conclusions. (I) An interest in important world-news of a variety of types, including political, historical, geographical, economic, and social, can be aroused in fifth- and sixth-grade pupils. (2) Fifth- and sixth-grade pupils can read world-news intelligently if it is presented to them with the proper explanations and in language suitable for young readers. (3) It seems probable that classroom use of a current-events paper which introduces pupils to important phases of world-news encourages reading of newspapers outside of class and serves as a guide to newspaperreading. (4) Attractive illustrations influence pupils' choices of stories. (5) A weekly current-events paper including enough material for a thirty-minute class period is sufficient to meet the needs of teachers of fifth and sixth grades.
