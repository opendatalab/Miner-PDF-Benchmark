INTRODUCTION

This study was supported by the State Cooperative Research Program of United States Department of Agriculture Grant No. 716-15-35-ARI to Langston University.

Getting into college is becoming increasingly more difficult, and this arises in part from the students' attitudes and preparation for the problems of funding. It is recognized, of course, that a lack of funds is only one of the reasons why some qualified students do not go to college. There are not enough colleges to admit all students wishing to enroll. Colleges are now feeling the pinch of the upward trend in birth rate in the 1950s. In the last twenty years births have almost doubled, and the nation is demanding more and more college graduates. The proportion of high school graduates going to college had increased from about 40 per cent in 1950 to about 56 per cent in the fall of 1967, (Simon, 1968, p. 7). Meanwhile, in the decade from 1966 to 1976 the total enrollment in institutions of higher education is projected to increase by approximately 58 per cent, (Simon, 1967, p. 15).

The well-to-do have little difficulty in getting admitted to an accredited college or university, but those that are not in this group have not had it so easy, and many Negro students are handicapped by their elementary education, (Pettigrew, 1967, p. 278). Many people throughout the country are recognizing that availability of college training should not depend on the ability to pay. Although many scholarships, fellowships, and other financial aids have been made available to assist some of those students who are too poor to finance their own college education, lack of funds limits or denies college opportunities to tens of thousands of potential students. Vontress notes the need for aggressive counseling of the $\mathrm{Ne}$ gro student nearing high school graduation. "The counselor must show them the need for a college education; he must try to develop a desire for college," (1968, p. 44). The motivation of the student for entering college is also closely related to occupational aspiration and choice, (Taylor, 1968, Chapter 7).

Many college students work for some or all of their college expenses. A recent survey for the Ford Foundation divulged some significant findings about American parents and their dreams versus the realities on the subject of a college education for their children. According to the Institute of Life Insurance, 70 per cent of the parents with precollege children among 5,000 surveyed expected one or more of the youngsters to go to college, but only 40 per cent of these parents had any savings or investment plan in operation to provide funds
for their children's higher education. Twothirds of those with average or belowaverage incomes at that time had made no start on such a savings plan (Lovejoy, 1967, p. 15). It was further pointed out that of those parents already having a savings plan underway, 60 per cent were relying heavily on their life insurance to help pay college bills.

This study is focused on the orientation of students in the three grade levels of six senior high schools in a rural county regarding attitudes and preparation to meet financial problems in post-high school training. For this purpose the attributes of sex, race, grade in school, vocational aspiration level, and academic performance level were related to a group of factors thought to be relevant to preparation for attending college.

## Methodology

The sample consisted of all children in attendance on the day of the survey in the six high schools in a rural county, totaling 765 students. Of these, 322 complete questionnaire sets were secured from the student, his father, and his mother. Respondents included 68 black students and 254 white students. Both parents and the child independently filled out the appropriate portion of a three-part questionnaire in order to get child-parent reciprocal ratings. The questionnaire included a number of items relative to finance and sources of support that would be available to the student for college or vocational-technical school. The questions dealt with such matters as the ability of the family to give help, the student's knowledge of available assistance, the amount of money the student would be willing to borrow, the willingness of the student to work part-iime while attending school, and his views relative to the amount of money that a student could earn under certain conditions.

Six items are included in the factors relating to college orientation. These factors included (1) work, (2) father's job, (3) financial preparation, (4) academic skill of the student, (5) rating of the student as a family member by mother, father, and himself, and (6) college preparation. Ten items made up the work factor, including four responses from the child and three each from the father and mother. The student listed the kinds of work he had done for pay, kinds of work for which he had had some training, his attitude toward work, and his rating of himself as a worker. Both his father and mother rated him as a worker, as a family member, and as a student, and they were asked to indicate how confident they were that their child would succeed in his plans after high school.

The father's job factor included six responses from the student plus four responses from the father. The student indicated his father's attitude toward his job and salary, his mother's attitude toward his father's job and salary, and finally, his own attitude toward his father's job and salary. The father also responded to questions about his attitude toward his work and salary, and about his wife's attitude toward his work and salary.

The financial preparation factor was made up from ten responses from the student. He responded to questions designed to ascertain how much money he expected he would actually be able to earn per week if he were to (1) take a permanent job before finishing high school, (2) take a permanent job after finishing vocational
school, and (3) take a permanent job after completing college. Responses to other questions making up the financial preparation factor included the readiness of the student's family to help him meet expenses in college or vocational school, the extent to which the student would be willing to work to pay his college or vocational school expenses, the amount of money the student believed he could earn per week working part-time on the school campus if he took a full course load, the amount of money the student believed he could earn per week with a part-time job at home or some place other than the school campus, whether or not a student could borrow money to attend college, and finally, how he would feel about borrowing money for his education. The ordinal scale values of the answers given by the student were added to yield an aggregate score for the financial preparation factor.

The academic skill factor was obtained from the answers the student gave when asked how he rated himself with regard to (1) reading, (2) writing, (3) public speaking, (4) use of the library, (5) preparation of assignments, (6) taking essay tests, (7) taking multiple choice tests, (8) extra-curricular activities, (9) attendance, and (10) participation in athletics. There were five scale points, from poor to excellent for each item. The aggregate score for the ten items made up the skill factor. A total of sixteen responses made up the rating as a family member including eight from the student, five from the father, and three from the mother. The student indicated how he rated his mother and father as parents; how his mother rated herself as a mother and how the student felt that his mother rated him as a child; how he felt his father rated himself as a father and how he felt his father rated him (the student). Finally, the student was asked to rate himself as a child to his mother and father.

The college preparation factor incorporated eight responses from the student. He was asked to indicate how confident he was of success in his post-high school plans, the number of times he had been on a college campus, and/or vocational school campus, the number of college and vocational school course catalogues he had examined in his high school library, the number of degree-granting vocational schools and colleges he thought existed in Oklahoma which he could attend and, finally, the steps required to get admitted to a degree-granting vocational school, college, or university.

## Findings

Table I shows the interrelations of the various college orientation factors using the Pearson product-moment correlation. For purposes of analysis the minimum value of $\mathrm{r}^{2} \geq .10(\mathrm{r} \geq .32)$ is used in evaluating the degree of effect between variables. Significant correlations were observed among work versus academic skill $(\mathrm{r}=.428)$, work versus rating as a family member ( $\mathrm{r}=.432$ ), work versus college preparation ( $\mathrm{r}=.325$ ), father's job versus money ( $\mathrm{r}=.369$ ), academic skill versus rating as a family member $(\mathrm{r}=.360$ ), and academic skill versus college preparation ( $\mathrm{r}=.48$ ). This suggests that a student's evaluation of his academic skills is positively related to the number of types of jobs he has done for pay and to his evaluation as a worker. Furthermore, it is easy to understand that a student having performed a greater variety of jobs would tend to be more confident of his ability regarding various

kinds of undertakings. The reverse is probably true for a student who possesses little or no skill. The significant correlation between father's job and money suggests that the amount of money earned has bearing on job satisfaction. It is not intended to argue that the adequacy of compensation plays the greatest part. A person's attitude toward his job is also affected by working conditions, prestige, wages or salary, and the attitude of family members toward work.

From Table I, it is apparent that college preparation is significantly affected by work and academic skill. Factors reflecting correlation ratios which do not meet the .01 criterion of significance include work versus father's job, father's job versus academic skill, and money versus rating as a family member.

While attempting to explain why col- lege preparation and work have signifcant correlation, one might ask whether or not the work experience, attitude toward work, and one's own rating or evaluation of himself as a worker should tend to raise aspirations, thus giving him a sense of wanting to better himself, particularly if he believes that he has the potential. It appears that when a person is able to see some degree of success, he is encouraged to strive for more success. In other words, if he can make one forward step, the satisfaction of doing so tends to motivate him to better his condition. Therefore, we expected our finding to show that a high score on the work factor would influence college preparation positively. This suggests that the individual would be more likely to have explored the possibility of entering a college or vocational school. On the other hand, if a person has little motiva-
tion and sees very little or no success in his work, he may feel that there is no reward for wanting or attempting to raise his level of aspiration. He would then be less likely to want to go to college and would have little reason to become involved in college preparation.

The relationship between father's job, money, and college preparation, and the effect of sex and race were evaluated by the Mann-Whitney Test. The same factors were related to grade in school, aspiration level, and academic performance by the Kruskal-Wallis Test. As shown in Table II, attitudes of family members toward father's job were significantly affected by race at the .001 level of significance. However, attitude toward father's job was not significantly associated by sex, grade, aspiration level or academic performance. The nonwhite respondents were seemingly more dissatisfied with father's job than the white respondents.

Work was significantly affected by grade in school, level of aspiration, and academic performance at the .001 level of significance. Work, on the other hand, was not significantly affected by sex and race. One might wonder why grade in school should make a difference. While in high school, students tend to develop very rapidly, and it is apparent that they are going through significant stages of development regarding work and college preparation year by year. They are at the point in life where they have the need to make their own decision regarding further schooling and vocation. Sophomores and seniors in high school were expected to manifest progressively more interest in work and college preparation. They appear to assume greater responsi- bility congruent with the expectations of their teachers and parents and with the proximity of graduation from high school.

The work that a student is willing to accept and perform diligently may depend to some degree on his educational goals and his vocational aspiration. Tweeten, (1968, p. 25), while discussing attitudes associated with individual economic performance, stated that:

Most studies of individual economic behavior are predicated on the assumption that (the) behavior is rational and goal-oriented, that a person does in fact work toward achieving his needs and goals. The goals and needs are conditioned by the cultural environment, by the biological makeup and personal experience of the individual, and by expectations of success which are conditioned by accessibility of goals in the social and physical environment.

Our findings tend to agree.

## Summary

A study was made of the academic aspiration and financial preparation of 322 high school students incorporating responses from mother, father, and student. An effort was made to gain insight of the student's standings with regard to their college orientation. College orientation comprised six factors: work, father's job, financial preparation, academic skill of the student, rating of the student as a family member by mother, father, and by himself, and college preparation. Each factor was derived from answers from an ordinal set of individual responses to questions pertaining to the factor. An aggregate score was used to designate each factor.

Analysis of the data using the "Pearson product-moment" correlation showed significant correlations among work versus

academic skill, work versus rating as a family member, work versus college preparation, father's job versus money, academic skill versus rating as a family member, and skill versus college preparation. College preparation was the only college orientation factor that had significant relationship to each of the other five factors, namely, work, father's job, money, skill, and rating as a family member. Factors not reflecting a significant correlation included work versus father's job, father's job versus skill, and money versus rating as a family member.

Upon analysis of the relation between father's job, money, and college preparation, and the effect of sex and race using the Mann-Whitney Test, it was found that attitudes of family members toward father's job were significantly affected by race at the .001 level of significance. Father's job, however, was not signifcantly affected by sex, grade in school, aspiration level or academic performance. Work was significantly affected by grade in school, level of aspiration, and academic performance at the .001 level of signifcance. Work, on the other hand, was not significantly affected by sex and race. We conclude that the dynamic and functional factors suggestive of adaptation and development are strongly related to the high school students preparation for entering college, while the static ascriptive factors (sex and race) have no significant effect.
