#### Abstract

A new beam transport channel was created on the ТИПр-1 accelerator at the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics to study interactions between charged particles with an energy of $0.1 \mathrm{MeV} /$ nucleon and matter with different aggregate states. The channel was designed for ion beams with specific weights as great as $35 \mathrm{au}$. It is composed of a transport line for an accelerated ion beam, three quadrupole lenses, the object of investigation (a gas, plasma, or foil sample), and a beam diagnostic system. The energy losses of doubly charged copper ions $\left(\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}\right)$ accelerated to $0.1 \mathrm{MeV} /$ nucleon in gases were measured for first time in the spring of 2004.


## INTRODUCTION

Тhe ТИПр-1 heavy-ion RFQ linac (the heavy-ion prototype) is able to produce accelerated ion beams with a broad mass spectrum (from $\mathrm{C}^{+}$to $\mathrm{U}^{4+}$ ), a current of $\sim 10 \mathrm{~mA}$, and an energy of $0.1 \mathrm{MeV} / \mathrm{nucleon}[1]$.

A heavy ion beam with the above parameters is a useful tool for studying interactions between heavy ions and matter having different aggregate states. These are currently being studied by a research team from the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics (Moscow) in collaboration with scientists from France (Institut de Physique Nucleaire, Orsay Cedex) and Germany (Friederich-Alexander University of Erlangen-
Nurnberg and Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung $\mathrm{GmbH}$, Darmstadt) [2-6]. The aim of this experiment is to measure the energy losses of heavy ions in both a hydrogen gas and gas-discharge plasmas and to compare the stopping power of neutral and ionized hydrogen for low energy ions. The target used in the study was described in [3]. An important feature of its design is the oppositely directed currents induced by the discharge in the collinear channels. This helps to minimize the influence of the "plasma lens" effect [7] on the beam transport process when the ion energy losses in the plasma are being measured.

To achieve the goals of the experiment, a beam line has been created on the ТИПр-1 accelerator that

includes a transport channel for the accelerated ion beam, a gas-plasma target, and a diagnostic system.

## MODELING THE ION BEAM TRANSPORT CHANNEL

The channel for transporting the ion beam from the output of the accelerating structure to the detector unit was simulated by means of the TRACE 3-D program [8]. For successful experiments, it was required that the greatest possible number of ions pass through the target and subsequently drift toward the detector unit. A chamber similar in dimensions to the actual device (including the differential pumping system components) was employed as a model for the gas-plasma target. The chamber was shaped as a cylinder with an i.d. of $6 \mathrm{~mm}$ and a length of $1 \mathrm{~m}$. The cylinder was closed on both sides with two apertures having 1 - and $2-\mathrm{mm}-$ diameter holes. In the actual target, an exhaust unit can be connected between the two apertures on each side of the cylinder to create a sharp pressure drop. The diagnostic equipment is located at a distance of $2 \mathrm{~m}$ behind the target. Using this model, we determined the target's maximum acceptance such that the beam losses inside the target in the absence of a discharge or gas are ruled out. A magnetic mass analyzer and a scintillation detector installed at its output are used as the diagnostic system. The size of the room where the ТИПр-1 accelerator is now situated limits the maximum length of the beam line, which must not exceed $6 \mathrm{~m}$.

While simulating the beam transport channel, we determined the location of the quadrupole lenses and their magnetic field gradients such that the phase characteristics of the ion beam accelerated in the ТИПр-1 linac are best matched to the specified target's acceptance. The initial parameters in calculating the beam transport channel were the phase characteristics obtained by simulating the beam dynamics in the ТИПр-1 accelerator by means of the DYNAMION program [9]. The measured emittance of a doubly charged copper ion beam accelerated in the ТИПр-1 linac showed good agreement with the results of our simulation $[1]$.

It was proposed that the beam line be developed on the basis of the КЛ-12-НИИФА quadrupole lenses that we had at our disposal. These lenses had an effective length of $235 \mathrm{~mm}$, a pole separation of $70 \mathrm{~mm}$, and a maximum magnetic field gradient of $12 \mathrm{~T} / \mathrm{m}[10,11]$. Using the algorithm and the physical models of the TRACE 3-D program, we analyzed the possibility of using these lenses to create a channel to transport the

uranium $\left(\mathrm{U}^{4+}\right)$ and copper $\left(\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}\right)$ ion beams. It was shown that six КЛ-12-НИИФА quadrupole lenses ensured the transport of the uranium $\left(\mathrm{U}^{4+}\right)$ ion beam with the required characteristics. The envelope and a phase-plane portrait of the $\mathrm{U}^{4+}$ ion beam are presented in Fig. 1. In addition, it was demonstrated that only three of the six lenses used to guide the $\mathrm{U}^{4+}$ ion beam were sufficient to transport the $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions (i.e., units 4 , 8 , and 12). The application of six lenses for the $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ion beam complicated the channel adjustment procedure, but did not lead to a significant increase in the beam

(This increased by no more than $10 \%$.) The current of the $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ion beam after its passing through the target was expected to be $1 \mu \mathrm{A}$, the beam current at the exit from the accelerator being $4 \mathrm{~mA}$. This value is sufficient for studying the interactions between the ion beam and matter with different aggregate states.

## BEAM LINE DESIGN

The design for the beam transport channel (Fig. 2) was based of the results from our simulation. The design allows all six of the quadrupole lenses required for transporting the $\mathrm{U}^{4+}$ ion beam to be installed. Behind the first pair of lenses is a chamber for installing the detectors used to monitor the beam parameters: a Faraday cup, a beam profile monitor (or a scintillation detector), and an emittance meter.

As has already been noted, the target is built into the existing vacuum system of the accelerator's beam line. A turbomolecular pump with an evacuation rate of $500 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{s}$ and used for differential pumping protects the beam line's vacuum system against a gas load. With such a system for evacuating the gas target, hydrogen refilling is ensured (according to the estimates, the gas is completely replaced within $1 \mathrm{~s}$ on the average) and the length of the gas column between the apertures is kept within the required limits. The experimental conditions require that the gas pressure inside the target be maintained at a level of $10^{2} \mathrm{~Pa}$. At the same time, the
pressure in the chamber with the accelerating system mounted inside must not exceed several hundred $\mu \mathrm{Pa}$. The design for the beam line therefore allows an auxiliary pump of the TMH-500 type to be connected to the measuring chamber located between the target and the accelerating system. A TMH-1500 pump is used to exhaust the beam transport channel at the exit from the magnet analyzer.

In the initial phase, the study will be performed on ion beams with a specific weight of no greater than 35 , e.g., with copper $\left(\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}\right.$ and $\left.\mathrm{Cu}^{3+}\right)$ and carbon $\left(\mathrm{C}^{+}\right)$ions. As follows from the results from our simulation, it is in this case sufficient to use only three quadrupole lenses $\left(L_{1}-L_{3}\right)$. It was this scheme that formed the basis for the first version of the beam line; three complementary lenses $L_{0}$ will be mounted later. An external view of the experimental setup with three quadrupole lenses and a plasma target is presented in Fig. 3.

## EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Simulations of the ion beam transport along the beam channel showed that the beam current at the target's output is only a few $\mu \mathrm{A}$, while the input current is 4-6 mA. For this reason, a target with the entrance and exit apertures $1 \mathrm{~mm}$ in diameter was used initially. After the magnetic field gradients in the quadrupole lenses reached the levels predicted by the simulation, the measured beam current at the target's output was as high as $14 \mu \mathrm{A}$, while the output current of the accelerating system was $6 \mathrm{~mA}$. This result was even higher than the theoretical values. A detector (a plastic scintillator with a luminescence decay time of $<5 \mu \mathrm{s}$, coupled to a photomultiplier tube) was placed at a distance of $75 \mathrm{~cm}$ behind the target to measure the ion energy losses in the matter by the time-of-flight method, using the stable RF beam structure. The detector signal is shown in Fig. 4.

The test of the beam line's vacuum system with the target installed showed that if only one $1-\mathrm{mm}$-diameter aperture was placed at the entry to and exit from target and the target was filled with hydrogen to a pressure of $75 \mathrm{~Pa}$, the pressure in the measuring chamber reached a value of $10^{-3} \mathrm{~Pa}$. This value exceeds the admissible limit at which the operation of the accelerating system is still stable. Placing an additional aperture $2 \mathrm{~mm}$ in diameter and $1 \mathrm{~cm}$ in depth at the entry to the plasma target offered a means for solving this problem: when the pressure inside the target was $200 \mathrm{~Pa}$, the pressure in the measuring chamber at the exit from the accelerator was as high as $4 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~Pa}$. As was expected, this aperture had no effect on the matched beam passing through the target. In fact, as follows from our calculation, the beam has a small angle of convergence at the entry to the target and crosses it virtually in parallel to its axis.
As a result, we can state that the extraction channel is ready for experiments with the aim of studying the interaction between a heavy ion beam with an energy of $0.1 \mathrm{MeV} /$ nucleon and matter having different aggregate states. The first investigations of the ion beam-gas interaction were successfully performed in the spring of $2004[12]$.
