#### Abstract

Falls of ground are a leading source of worker injury and fatality indicating a persistent need for advances in ground monitoring technology. The highresolution target movement monitor (HRTMM) is an experimental convergence monitor utilising a digital camera and custom software to track the position of one or more lasers across a target. The potential uses of the HRTMM include convergence monitoring in underground mining or tunnelling applications. For this article, the HRTMM was installed in an underground lead mine near active operations to test its response to three aspects of the mining environment: the ability of the monitor to survive intense blasting vibrations; error from the vibrations of close-proximity heavy equipment; and mine fog error. Improvements to the monitor design are identified from the mine blast test, the measurement error from light fog is determined, and vibrations from nearby equipment are shown to be inconsequential to convergence monitoring activities with the HRTMM.

## 1. Introduction

Underground year-to-date fatality figures provided by the Mine Safety and Health Administration indicate that falling material is still a primary source of concern for operators. In fact, fatalities caused by fall of the back and fall of the face or rib have increased continuously each year over the last 5 years [1]. This fact alone provides enough reason to pursue methods of providing a safer working environment in underground mines.

A pervasive safety culture within a company can have great benefits to its safety record, and exposure prevention will be an important part of that culture. A primary method of preventing exposure of personnel to unsafe areas where falling material[^0]could cause harm is by carefully monitoring potential threats to warn of impending failures. The fact that fatalities due to fall of ground have actually been increasing in recent years suggests that this is one area in which operators need to improve their safety measures.

The high-resolution target movement monitor (HRTMM) is a convergence monitor primarily designed for underground use [2]. Extensive testing in a laboratory setting has shown that it is a potential method for alerting operators to impending failures of the back or ribs. The sensitivity of the HRTMM is dependent upon the setup of the monitor, but sensitivities equal to or better than many other convergence monitors commonly in use in mining can be reliably achieved [3]. Further testing under field conditions has been completed and the results are presented here. This article includes evaluation of how the monitor behaves in close proximity to a large production blast and in the presence of mine fog.

## 2. HRTMM setup

The HRTMM is designed to be easily installed in underground mines. It consists of four separate components, all of which are firmly attached to the ribs of the mine for these tests. The first component is the camera. This incorporates a Nikon D200 digital camera with $300 \mathrm{~mm}$ lens fixed on a three-way adjustable, heavy-duty tripod head. It also includes an inexpensive laser pointer aimed to correspond with the line of sight of the camera. The lens is outfitted with a $635-\mathrm{nm}$ filter, which prevents the majority of the visible spectrum from entering the image. This has the effect of increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in the image.

The second component is the target. This consists of a uniformly thick sheet of stainless steel attached perpendicularly to the direction of movement of a micrometer movement stage. The stage is accurate to $0.0254 \mathrm{~mm}(0.001$ in). A mirror is temporarily affixed to the stainless steel target and is used to help ensure proper alignment of the camera and the target. These are all mounted on another three-way adjustable, heavy-duty tripod head. These two pieces must be adjusted so that the laser on the camera mount reflects off the mirror on the target and back to the source. This assures that the plane of the image sensor on the camera is parallel to the plane of the target. Although this parallel alignment is not strictly necessary for the monitor to function, doing so eliminates one source of error from the measurements.

The third part of the HRTMM is a mount for the laser or lasers projected onto the target. This consists of a $360^{\circ}$ rotational stage that allows the position of the lasers to be measured and adjusted. It also includes a mount designed to allow the lasers to be adjusted in the other two dimensions. The gradations on the rotational stage allow for rough measurements of the incidence angle, though a much more accurate measurement is usually found trigonometrically from the measured distance between the target and lasers, and the camera and lasers, which all form a triangle.

The final component is a laptop computer with accompanying custom written HRTMM software. This software analyses the laser dots on the target and locates their centroids within a frame of reference corresponding to the pixels on the digital image. The $X$-axis increases from left to right while the $Y$-axis increases from top to bottom. If the camera and target move closer together, the dots will move across the target due to the incident angle of the laser with respect to the target. The change in
centroid position can be translated for determination of the amplitude of the movement [4].

The design of each section (except the laptop) allows it to be fixed to the end of a threaded rock bolt or other rock anchor. Components 1-3 are shown in Figure 1 as attached to the walls in the mine. In the case of these evaluations, a 15.9-mm (5/8 in) Hilti Kwik Bolt 3 was used as the anchor.

With respect to the HRTMM, the settings used on the camera and lens are critical to data quality and the ability of the HRTMM to work in high ambient light situations. The settings found in Table 1 have known from experience to work very well. They provide the HRTMM with the ability to capture data in almost any ambient lighting condition (direct sunlight causes difficulty) and drastically reduce noise in the data.

## 3. Mine fog

### 3.1. Fog evaluation procedure

All the field tests described in this article were completed in two areas of the Fletcher mine, owned and operated by the Doe Run Company. The mine is located in southeast Missouri in the Viburnum trend. The evaluations of the monitor behaviour in the presence of mine fog were completed in the intersection between

pillars $2869,2870,2871$ and $2852 \mathrm{~N}$. The fog density at the time of testing was quite thin, but it was the heaviest available on that day. On a scale of $1-10$ with 1 being clear and 10 being zero visibility, the fog at this location was subjectively considered to be at 3. It was expected that results would have been much worse given heavier fog conditions. Owing to Mie scattering through the fog, increased error would have been recorded [5]. Though not addressed directly in this article, high quantities of airborne dust around the monitor would cause a similar reaction to that found with fog. This is because of their similar particle sizes.

The monitor was installed spanning across the intersection between the four pillars. The camera was mounted on one corner while the target was mounted opposite to the camera on a micrometer stage. A mirror and a laser were used to align the target and the camera to ensure that the plane of the target was parallel to the plane of the camera's sensor. A separate set of three lasers was mounted on a third corner on a mounting platform and aligned in the plane of the camera's sensor, forming a right triangle between these three components. Three lasers were used, the intent being to increase the number of data points collected. These lasers were then focussed at an incidence angle of $50^{\circ}$ from normal to the target, projecting three dots onto the target (Figure 2). The laser dots projected on the target are numbered from the top down and from the left to the right across the image. The proper dot number can be found in Figure 3. Distances were measured with a Hilti Laser Range Meter.

Figure 3. Numbering of laser dots in image.

Data collection was accomplished with the use of a laptop computer connected to the camera via a USB cable for data download and automatic shutter control. This was done to limit vibration caused by manually operating the camera, known to be a problem from early monitor testing [4]. The lasers were allowed to warm up for $\sim 1 \mathrm{~h}$ prior to data collection in order to mitigate the effects of thermal drift. Once the setup was complete, the computer was used to take 50 images with the camera. The images were taken $2 \mathrm{~s}$ apart. Upon completion of the first data collection, the micrometer stage was used to move the target $12.7 \mathrm{~mm}(0.5 \mathrm{in})$ away from the camera. The camera and computer then captured 50 more images. The camera had the same settings throughout the process (Table 1). These settings have been shown to be the best for data collection for this camera [3]. They allow the camera to capture the data regardless of the ambient lighting found in an underground mine. After the data collection, the data were analysed. Dividing the distance the target was moved by the number of pixels each laser dot moved across the image gives the resolution of the monitor (for that laser dot) in millimeters. Comparison of the movement of the dots across the target for each of the three lasers revealed that a very different resolution was recorded for each dot (Table 2). This should not be possible under normal circumstances and it has not been encountered in previous testing.

Continuation and expansion on the work presented in [3], has developed a much more accurate equation for predicting the potential resolution of the HRTMM. The development of this equation is outside the scope of this article, but it can be found in Equation (1) taking both the distance between the target and the camera and the angle of incidence of the lasers into account. The original published equation did not consider the angle of the lasers but instead relied upon a constant incident angle of $30^{\circ}$. In this equation, $S$ is the sensitivity of the monitor in millimetres, $R_{c}$ is a resolution coefficient equal to $0.033598853, \theta$ is the laser incidence angle, and $D$ is the distance to the target in metres.

$$
S=R_{c} \tan (\theta-90) D
$$

According to this equation, it can be expected that the monitor should produce a resolution of $0.18 \mathrm{~mm}(0.0071 \mathrm{in})$. It is clear from this that all the results are higher than the expected outcome, especially the resolution calculated for laser 1. Attempts were made to understand the source of this error.

### 3.2. Fog error analysis and discussion

The data for all three lasers were normalised to isolate the variation between lasers. The $X$ and $Y$ locations were plotted against image number to see whether there was

Table 2. Centroid movement and resolution for each laser while testing the effects of mine fog.

| Laser number | Target movement | Pixel dot movement | Sensor resolution |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | $12.7 \mathrm{~mm}(0.500 \mathrm{in})$ | 16.8688 pixels | $0.753 \mathrm{~mm}(0.030 \mathrm{in})$ |
| 2 | $12.7 \mathrm{~mm}(0.500 \mathrm{in})$ | 36.6880 pixels | $0.346 \mathrm{~mm}(0.014 \mathrm{in})$ |
| 3 | $12.7 \mathrm{~mm}(0.500 \mathrm{in})$ | 46.7347 pixels | $0.272 \mathrm{~mm}(0.011 \mathrm{in})$ |

consistency between the behaviours of all the three lasers (Figures 4 and 5). This was done to help in understanding the source of the error in the data. If all the three lasers reacted similarly, that would mean that the source of the error was movement or vibration in the mounting brackets themselves. If the lasers reacted differently, that would mean that the source of error was external to the monitor; the error would have been due to the fog.

The two graphs show that there is good correlation between the lasers in the $Y$ axis of the image for all the three lasers. Perfect correlation in these graphs would be shown by having all the three lasers change in exactly the same manner so that all the three lasers would maintain the same $Y$-axis value as in Figure 5. It is clear that the

lasers did not respond as well in the image $X$-axis direction (Figure 4). From this comparison, it is understood that the majority of the error in this test occurred in the horizontal plane with only a small amount of the error occurring in the vertical plane. Finding the average correlation between the three lasers in both directions gives 0.993 in the image $Y$-axis and 0.752 in the image $X$-axis, again indicating that there is more variation in the data along the image $X$-axis. One potential source of this error is that because all three lasers are in the horizontal ( $X$-axis) plane relative to the camera and target, when the target was moved away from the camera there was some error introduced. This is considered unlikely, as this target-movement method has worked successfully many times before. Another source of error that is considered much more likely is that because the monitor was installed in a generally horizontal roadway with a horizontal airflow, moving air and fog could have altered the laser propagation path more in the horizontal plane than in the vertical plane.

Figure 5 shows that the amplitude of the laser movement is greater than in Figure 4. This amplitude difference is not relevant for the determination of the cause of error because of the normalisation process. Effectively, this serves to eliminate any error introduced into the results from movement of any of the mounting platforms by air flow, human interference, or any vibration sources. Cause is determined by noticing the difference in how the lasers acted relative to one another since they were all mounted in the same bracket (Figure 1). Thus, it is known that the error represented in the figure is strictly caused by interference as the laser propagates between the laser aperture, the target, and the reflection back to the camera.

A third possible source of error is a small misalignment that was noticed between the three lasers. Ideally, the three laser beams would be parallel. From the photographs and measurements taken at the site, this misalignment is estimated to be no more than $0.02^{\circ}$ for laser number 1 . While this small error source exists, this angle is much too small to have a noticeable effect on the monitor at this distance with a target movement as small as $12.7 \mathrm{~mm}(0.500 \mathrm{in})$. The error corresponds to a laser centroid movement of $4.80 \mathrm{E}^{-3} \mathrm{~mm}\left(1.89 \mathrm{E}^{-4}\right.$ in) across the target and so is below the practical resolution of the HRTMM. The misalignment can be seen in Figure 3. In the mount, the three lasers were arranged in an equilateral triangle while in the figure the three lasers are in the form of an acute triangle.

A fourth possible source of error would be thermal drift. Even though the lasers were allowed to warm up for $\sim 1 \mathrm{~h}$, which should be sufficient for thermal stability to occur, some of the data analysis suggest that the lasers may not have fully stabilised at the time of data collection. It can be seen in Figure 6 that the range of values covered by the first 50 images is significantly larger than that covered by the 50 images following target movement. This trend can be seen in all the three lasers and is indicative of thermal drift. This is a likely source of the error seen in Table 2. Thermal stabilisation is assumed for the data following target movement because the characteristics of that data match with those found previously in a laboratory setting with lasers known to be stabilised.

A potential reason that thermal drift may have taken longer to occur in this setting is that the three lasers were mounted in a solid, aluminium housing and capped off by silicone sealant to prevent excessive water entry. This housing completely surrounded the lasers and could have acted as a heat sink, potentially increasing the thermal stabilisation time. In previous testing to determine the length of time required for thermal drift elimination, the mass around the lasers was much

less and the ends of the lasers were completely open to the air which would have caused faster stabilisation time.

## 4. Mine vibrations

### 4.1. Mine blast vibration

Two types of vibrations were evaluated during this underground trial. Vibrations from a major mine production blast were considered in order to test the ruggedness of the monitor components and to form an idea about how close to a major vibration source the monitor could be placed and still gather high-quality data. The error of the monitor was determined by comparing a set of data taken both before and after a major blast. The ruggedness was considered subjectively from personal inspection of the equipment and later from images taken of the setup before and after for comparison purposes. The ruggedness was, of course, directly linked to the data quality. A perfect result would be if the aim of the camera or lasers, or the orientation of the target did not change from the mine blast. Gauging the influence of ongoing vibrations from heavy machinery operating nearby was evaluated by comparing the average precision of data gathered with and without the influence of the machinery vibrations.

### 4.2. Blast vibration evaluation

The vibration evaluation for this article was completed in the 67C5 area of the Fletcher mine between pillars 2344 and 2294. The monitor was set up in the same fashion as for the fog test, though the distances were slightly different (Figure 7). The source of vibration for this experiment was a standard production blast and consisted of $\sim 159 \mathrm{~kg}(350 \mathrm{lbs})$ of dynamite and $567 \mathrm{~kg}(1250 \mathrm{lbs})$ of ammonium nitrate-fuel oil. This was dispersed across a $4.3 \mathrm{~m}(14 \mathrm{ft}) \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m}(32 \mathrm{ft})$ face area in 65 holes with 15 different delays. The maximum charge per delay was eight delays with $\sim 89.3 \mathrm{~kg}(197 \mathrm{lbs})$ of explosives.

The experiment was designed to test the resistance of the monitor to vibration. To get the maximum vibration possible it was placed as close to the blast as safely possible for both researchers and the equipment. Based on mine surveys, the estimated distance from the centre of the blast to the target was $\sim 22 \mathrm{~m}(74 \mathrm{ft})$, to the



Figure 7. Location of the HRTMM components relative to the blasted heading.

camera $30 \mathrm{~m}(99 \mathrm{ft})$, and to the laser mount it was $27 \mathrm{~m}(89 \mathrm{ft})$. The blast was located in the adjacent drift directly north of the monitor.

According to Equation (2), the scaled distance for the maximum charge per delay is 5.28 for the target, 6.34 for the laser mount, and 7.05 for the camera where $S D$ is the scaled distance, $d$ is the distance between the component and the centre of the blast, and $w$ is the maximum weight of explosive per delay. The peak particle velocity (PPV) for each component can be estimated from Equation (3) where $V$ is the PPV [6]. The PPV can be used as a benchmark for comparison with future blast tests.

$$
\begin{gathered}
S D=d w^{-1 / 2} \\
V=242(S D)^{-1.6}
\end{gathered}
$$

Given these equations, the PPV at the location of the target was estimated to be $429.0 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{s}(16.89 \mathrm{in} / \mathrm{s})$, at the lasers it was $320.0 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{s}(12.60 \mathrm{in} / \mathrm{s})$, and at the lasers it was $270.0 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{s}(10.63 \mathrm{in} / \mathrm{s})$.

The test procedure was to set up the monitor, capture 50 images, and then evacuate the area for the blast without turning off the monitor. Prior to evacuation, a plastic sheet was placed over the camera, except for a hole at the lens, to help keep it clean and protect it from dust and small rocks should they fall during the blast. After the air cleared, 50 more images were captured without moving the target. If the monitor components had remained stationary there would have been be no movement of the laser dot within the images between the pre- and post-blast data.

It is assumed that the components of the monitor did not undergo actual movement to rock displacement after the blast. This assumption is based on a number of factors. The area was known to have competent rock and very little damage was noticed following the blast. As the blast was in the end of a heading, the blasted area was well-supported by three faces even after the blast. The time between the pre- and post-blast data collection was only about $16 \mathrm{~h}$, leaving a relatively short time during which displacement could occur. Finally, previous research and extensive experience by the mine operators have both shown that the area
experiences very small displacements on the order of one or two thousandths of an inch of vertical convergence per month in isolated areas of the mine $[7,8]$.

Upon completion of data evaluation, the results found were quite encouraging relative to the magnitude of vibration experienced by the monitor. Inspection of the monitor following the blast showed that the target and camera and their corresponding mounts appeared both in person and in before-and-after photographs to have remained stationary. Even though the laser mount itself appeared to remain stationary, the battery pack for the lasers was dislodged and was found hanging by its wires. Even though this equipment failed, all three lasers remained operational and did not fall out of the mount.

However, the dangling battery pack provided enough of a direct disturbance to the lasers to alter their propagation significantly. Measuring in degrees counterclockwise from the positive $X$-axis, Table 3 shows how each laser moved following the blast. The maximum movement of any laser was 11.78 pixels, which is an error of only $1.706 \mathrm{~mm}(0.067 \mathrm{in})$. The average error was $1.597 \mathrm{~mm}(0.063 \mathrm{in})$. If actually in use for ground convergence monitoring, this error would be so large that it would be use-prohibitive; however, given the size and proximity of the blast and potential improvements to the monitor and testing method, the overall test result was considered positive. Simply repairing the attachment for the battery pack should be enough to remove the greatest part of the error induced by the intense mine blast.

### 4.3. Heavy equipment vibrations

During the post-blast data collection the adjacent heading was being mucked. Consequently, the 50 images collected at that time were subjected to vibrations transmitted from the heavy machinery. Multiple 45 -ton haul trucks and a large loader were within roughly $50 \mathrm{ft}$ of the monitor components, with the closest component being the incident lasers. If the vibrations from the equipment were strong enough to impart significant vibration to any of the monitor components the result would be a decrease in monitor precision (increase in random error) for the post-blast dataset relative to the pre-blast dataset.

To determine the precision of the monitor in each of the datasets the centroid locations were averaged along both the $X$ - and $Y$-axes directions for each of the three lasers. The six individual standard deviations $(\sigma)$ accompanying the data were determined and represent the random error of the monitor in each direction. The same steps were taken with the pre-blast data and both results are shown Table 4. It is obvious that in every data pair the post-blast standard deviation was slightly higher than in the pre-blast data. Based on these results the initial conclusion was that the vibrations from the heavy equipment were strong enough to cause

| Before $\sigma$ | 1.36 | 2.03 | 1.39 | 2.01 | 1.40 | 1.97 |
| After $\sigma$ | 1.38 | 2.63 | 1.42 | 2.71 | 1.47 | 2.63 |

additional random error in the results. If this were the case the monitor may not be able to be installed along a passage used for frequent transportation, which would be a major detraction for its use.

To verify the conclusion, each data pair was submitted to a two-tailed $F$-test to determine whether the null hypothesis that the two precision values were actually equal could be rejected. The $F$-test was conducted at the $99 \%$ confidence level and in every case it was found that the null hypothesis could not be rejected. These results do not prove that the amount of random error both with and without the presence of heavy operating machinery was the same, but they do favour that conclusion quite heavily. This does mean that the installation of the monitor within close proximity to operating heavy machinery would not be likely to harm the data

produced.

### 4.4. Vibration error analysis and discussion

The intense vibrations of the close-proximity production blast were enough to dislodge the battery pack for the incident lasers from the laser mount and leave it dangling. The corresponding induced measurement error was considered enough that the data might have been unusable if the accident had occurred during actual monitoring activities. This problem has a simple solution and can be easily repaired eliminating the imparted error. Fortunately, both the camera and target platforms appeared to hold firmly.

Another potential error source for the blast test was a decrease in the battery power for the lasers. The lasers were active continuously for $\sim 18.5 \mathrm{~h}$. The lasers were not turned off between the fog test and the blast test in order to prevent them from cooling down, thereby causing thermal drift. Owing to the fumes from the explosives the lasers could not be deactivated after the blast either. This long operational period ( $\sim 18.5 \mathrm{~h})$ could have depleted the battery levels enough to cause the intensity of the laser dot to decrease. A decreased laser intensity would have been sensed by the HRTMM and would have caused the centroid of the laser spot to move, introducing another error. This would not have affected the results of the heavy equipment vibration test, but could have exaggerated the error of the blast test. That being said, the test was still considered successful as it pointed out the weak link in the laser platform, allowing it to be reinforced. It is considered unlikely that in normal use the HRTMM would ever actually be installed so close to an active face that it would exceed these vibration levels.

## 5. Conclusions

The fog test showed that even with light fog the standard deviation of the data points increased up to $372 \%$ over control values. Thicker fog would be likely to increase this error even further or completely attenuate the laser beam. Given the small
amount of fog present at the monitor location, the test will be repeated in the University of Missouri-Rolla experimental mine under more controlled circumstances.

The results of the test indicate the importance of allowing all lasers to warm up completely before beginning data collection. Previous tests have shown that the effects of thermal drift could be mitigated if the lasers were allowed to warm up for at least an hour. While this was done as part of this evaluation it is possible that the environmental conditions could have had the effect of slowing down the warm-up process, though it is unlikely as it was a very warm day and the mine was warm as well when the mine tests were completed. Also, when the initial laboratory tests were completed the laser diode was open to the air, while these three lasers were fixed in a solid aluminium mount which also could have gathered heat from the environment. A simple test looking at the movement of a $5 \mathrm{~mW}$ laser over time in the laser mount used for testing would clear up this question. This test should be completed in the laboratory.

The monitor reacted relatively well to blast vibrations. While the error found from this test would be prohibitive for normal ground convergence monitoring, it is very dependent upon the proximity of the monitor to the blast site. It is unlikely that mines would install ground monitoring systems quickly enough that it would ever be as close to the face as the monitor was in this test. Simply reinforcing the battery pack/mounting platform connection would be sufficient to solve this problem. Once these improvements are completed, the monitor should be tested for accuracy and precision again in similar vibration circumstances. The camera mounting platform and the target mounting platform both performed very well in withstanding the abuse of the blast vibrations and should not need improvement.

The vibration testing allowed the researchers to investigate the hypothesis that the vibrations of heavy equipment travelling through the air and rockmass would be enough to introduce error into the measurements taken by the monitor. This potential problem was of concern because should the monitor prove to be susceptible to those vibrations then it would drastically reduce the potential of the system for monitoring in the locations that are most frequented by employees and equipment. Fortunately, statistical analysis did not support this conclusion and hence it is very likely that the installation of the HRTMM along an underground haul road or other frequently travelled area would not be a problem.
