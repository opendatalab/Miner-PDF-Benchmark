# Janforum <br> Innovation in nursing - the role of higher education in relation to nursing practice 

## THE NATURE OF INNOVATION

Reflecting on recent events in the United Kingdom it is not easy to see many major new external factors generating innovatory changes in nursing. The new British statutory bodies for nursing, midwifery and health visiting, i.e. the United Kingdom Central Council and the new National Boards, have not yet had time to produce any startling proposals. Perhaps the main influence has been a continual reduction in resources which could ultimately produce innovatory ideas in practice in response to the long-term effects.

Interest in innovation and a subsequent exploration of this idea has led me to the conclusion that there is a prolific amount of literature on the subject of innovation putting forward a range of ideas and many different models. A number of nursing journals have various expositions of adapted theories particularly in the field of nursing education and curriculum changes. However there is much less in the way of evaluation or documentation on the results of innovation in nursing. Some small scale studies exist and a number of papers evaluating new curriculum ideas-but there appears to be little tangible evidence of more widespread influences worth adopting on a national scale that might revolutionize nursing care. This poses a number of questions relating to difficulties in establishing innovatory practices in nursing - the reluctance of the profession to adopt new ideas, the traditional structure and its constricting effects, the dominance of medical models and practice and the personalities of individuals who enter the[^0]

nursing profession. Historical influences also predominate and the very structure of the whole health service in the United Kingdom seems to offer such prolific variables of such an unwieldy nature that it seems almost impossible to implement new ideas however valuable they might seem. One can see obvious examples from the last $20-30$ years in the various reports and documents which were produced and lay ineffective for years. The (Briggs) Report of the Committee on Nursing (HMSO 1972) resulted in legislation only 8 years later and even today, 12 years after the report, with the statutory bodies in existence, we still have the same system and events overtake proposals before they become practicable. So, planned innovation for structural change seems slow and ponderous on the face of the evidence.

Another example is the difficulty encountered in initiating any changes in practice as a result of research findings, which, however convincing the evidence, appear to get no further than library shelves or learned papers. The area where innovation appears to have had a quiet but substantial influence is in the field of nursing and higher education. Here there appears to have been no major national policy, no planned structural revolution, no one particular school of thought, but a quiet revolution has taken place. I have explored this in some detail in an occasional paper (Owen 1984). The paper was not prepared for the purpose of highlighting the success of innovation (if the establishment of degree courses for nurses can be called innovatory) but it does demonstrate that there is one remarkable similarity in the historical pattern of development that can be shown in the USA, Canada and the United Kingdom.

Most of the innovatory courses established in higher education in these three countries, grew as a result of the vision of one person or a team of individuals who found themselves in a situa-
tion where innovation was possible. They themselves were also prepared and had, apart from their own distinctive academic and professional qualifications, some original ideas with which they wished to experiment and a sense of personal vision. It may be significant that they found themselves within an academic structure which allowed for creativity and innovation, but that alone would not have been sufficient because they had to overcome the most complicated obstacles to ensure the students could gain their professional credibility. Some of us well remember the early battles we had in the process of trying to obtain state registration as a nurse (SRN) for our own undergraduates without actually taking the existing SRN examination and that was only achieved in 1969.

One wonders whether since then we have gone far enough in identifying the kinds of differences we expect to find between graduate nurses and those coming through the hospitalbased schools of nursing, let alone producing tools sufficiently sophisticated to evaluate such differences-but that is another story.

It does then seem possible that innovation in the nursing profession is more likely to succeed where there are leaders with vision and tenacity, and when they are located within a structure that allows for creativity - but that is pure speculation. It does however fit in with some of the theoretical concepts on innovation so it is worth summarizing very briefly some aspects of theory which are relevant.

## Theoretical context

Miles (1966) defines innovation as a 'species of the genus change' and links it very much with the idea of newness or change. Dictionaries describe innovation as 'something new' so the idea of 'newness' either adds something to the concept of change, or is some specific aspect of it. Innovation is often seen in the context of theories of social change, but no one single theory or framework has been explored which is generally applicable (Smith 1976). Those that do allow a basis for consideration of innovation might be found in historical and neoevolutionary approaches. Perhaps the most applicable is diffusionist theory which suggests that innovatory changes originate mainly outside of a given pattern or unit, and the observer must locate the specific channels through which the influences of change effect or influence a unit or area. Communication theory is basic to this approach. This would tend to open up the area of discussion as to the most successful ways of communicating our innovatory experience in higher education to the nursing profession as a whole. This seems to be a key issue worth further exploration.

Change involves the breaking up of old patterns and the formation of new ones - an inevitable aspect of innovation being implemented. Such changes can occur in the structural framework of society or social institutions but subsequently roles and expectations are then disturbed and these are part of the fabric of our society. Alternatively the changes may be in the organizational aspects of an institution. The problems that arise often do so because when innovation causes changes in the structural framework, new patterns are established, but human and individual attitudes and behaviour patterns remain unchanged, traditional or static. This highlights one of our major difficulties in nursing practice. We are all familiar with the implications of the effects of innovation for the individual. It is known to generate insecurity, pose a threat, and to create aggressive responses, conflict and apathy. It certainly generates resistance (Moore 1974) and often encourages new regulations to be generated, which promptly become institutionalized. Merton (1957) saw innovation as a form of deviance which leads to the formation of new goals, and changes in principles of practice which may certainly violate the standards of some individuals (Lapierre 1965) particularly in nursing.

Alternatively planned innovation can bring creative opportunities and responses and allow for human ingenuity and initiative, while conflict and uncertainty may well generate new thoughts and ideas. When old patterns go, man's need for stability generates new roles and expectations and establishes new patterns of behaviour, and values and beliefs are sought anew. Thus innovation can be challenging and open up new potential and generate new and more efficient ways of utilizing resources or reforming practice.

Studies show individual innovators themselves are not necessarily inventors, but often they are first to accept and adopt new ideas. They are usually creative and often regarded as deviants (Smith 1976). Rogers (1962) suggests the individual needs to escape from his surroundings in order to innovate, and shows that if innovation is to be effective its not so much the context or content of the innovation that is important but the response of the recipient unit or system. In Rogers (1962) view it is the communicability of the innovation - its simplicity and compatibility with established values and experiences - which is crucial for the rate of adoption and its success. Rogers (1962) does not, however, comment further on the reasons why some individuals are more venturesome than others, or the nature of the sources of creativity at the root of the innovation.

Hagen (1964) and McLelland (1961) however concentrate on the kind of background that may well produce innovative personalities'early training in mastery', for example, breeds a high need for achievement which often drives individuals to seek out alternative practices. Most writers indicate that the individual, however, is very dependent on the nature and context of organizational framework which plays an important part in allowing innovatory ideas to gain a supportive response. So a combination of personality characteristics and a favourable structural framework together with good communication facilities seems to be important from the theoretical studies summarized.

One other theoretical perspective is interesting in relation to the higher education contribution. Jupp (1972) supports Prandy's (1965) approach which suggests that professionalization includes aspiration for status and prestige. Jupp expands this, taking the status inconsistency perspective, saying that the recent establishment of nursing studies in the higher education sector is an attempt to resolve the inconsistencies between the 'status quo' and full professional status - so our innovatory courses could be seen in that light.

McFarlane (1970) however sees professional education as something more than just a striving towards status. She maintains that nursing education for professional practice equips the individual with skills and knowledge and this enables full development of potential for con- tributing towards the care of the patient, the quality of the service and thus to the community as a whole.

At this point it seems the theoretical perspective brings us full circle to our 'raison d'être'. In other words - why are we here? I would like to put forward a few questions we might explore together, particularly in an attempt to indicate what contribution the Association of Integrated and Degree Courses in Nursing (AIDCN) might have in crossing those communication barriers between extending the frontiers of knowledge and developing creative and innovative ideas and the reality of utilizing such innovation in nursing practice.

## Contributions of innovations in higher education

Opinions range widely concerning the value of higher education to nursing. There are some who contend it is an expensive and labourintensive luxury that only serves to create an elitist group. Be that as it may, some innovatory elements can be identified. Perhaps the most obvious one relates to the diversity of course philosophies and curricula. For example, we have degrees in nursing, degree-linked courses or degrees with nursing, degrees before and after nursing, and although as yet we have no evaluative tools to define these differences, to the interested observer, particularly those of us who examine on a number of courses, we are able to identify a different perspective on nursing in students coming from these courses. Here then is an area where innovative thinking has gone into the course planning and curriculum and surely the differences in the end product must result in different kinds of practitioners. Have these courses anything to say to the new statutory bodies to guide them in planning nurse education of the future? Experimentation can be expensive and some of us may have learned what doesn't work and what to avoid.

Then again, course philosophies differ; some include or start with actual community-based experience, or a specific theoretical or conceptual approach and this may well shape perspective. The higher education innovations actually started after the 1949 Nurses Act allowed for experiments, and experimentation in the academic world had plenty of scope. To what
extent have we been able to evaluate the end result and sift out the useful and efficient from the useless and extravagant?

The other major area which could be innovatory is in the research field - actually research studies of course only tell us what is. They do not tell us what to do or how to do it! Therein lies the rub - and the potential innovation in nursing practice often grinds to a halt. A bridging process is therefore needed.

Nurses in higher education are often in a position to be able to explore new theoretical and conceptual approaches to practice. They have opportunities for library research and interchange of academic ideas and many themselves have their own specific academic disciplines and can produce innovatory models which could provide a good basic framework for practice. Once again the bridge from theory to practice seems to be a limiting factor. It is of little use to write learned papers if they are unintelligible and inaccessible to those who are doing the job.

These are a few of the areas to which the AIDCN could address itself with profit. Indeed they were embodied in the thinking of the Association's pioneers.

## Identification of problem areas

Of course the consideration in this paper has focused on nursing education in the further and higher education sectors, but that is not to suggest that innovatory ideas are not generated from other sources. Indeed where this happens they are probably more likely to be implemented because as Rogers (1962) shows, new ideas and innovations produced and introduced by a peer group are often more successfully adopted and established in practice. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why much innovatory work in the further and higher education sectors is often ignored or not recognized as valuable.

Looking first at the innovators themselves, we have seen that Rogers (1962) identifies them often as deviants and early adopters of new ideas, opinion leaders, or those with a high need to achieve. It is quite likely that many individuals with these characteristics find the bureaucracy of the National Health Service (NHS) restrictive and seek satisfaction from within an institutional setting where deviant ideas are more readily tolerated and perhaps more likely to be feasible. Where they are found in the health service structure, the framework may well be too rigid to allow for a great amount of experimentation. Perhaps however we could seek out the 'opinion leaders' who must remain in the structure, and make more use of our contacts with them in implementing new ideas.

The rigidity of the framework may well be a deterrent for those wishing to experiment with new ideas; the literature certainly indicates that flexibility of structure is an important feature and this kind of flexibility has in the past existed in educational institutions. Indeed originality was welcomed in designing new course programmes. Present constraints however may become a limiting factor here.

Many of the early innovators who succeeded in education were themselves opinion leaders, and they actually broke into the academic structure from outside. This in itself presented problems and was a slow process. Reinkeymeyer (1968) was famous for her comments that British nurses did not want university courses, the universities denied that nursing could be an academic subject and this created a paralytic ambivalence. So what was the factor that enabled the breakthrough? It is difficult to be sure, and must have been a combination of the flexible structure, innovatory ideas and deviant personalities who were high achievers. The main problem for them was getting back into the structure of the profession and this took some time. In fact it has never completely been resolved because nursing undergraduates still have to work at breaking through the barriers at grass roots level.

One of the main problem areas however lies in that of communications, and this certainly seems to be where some of the main bridges yet need to be built. All the literature points to the importance of this: one of our weakest links in reality. First of all we have to break out of or into two different institutional structures and somehow integrate more effectively theoretical ideas with practice in reality and we all know the difficulties inherent in this situation. Rogers (1962) emphasises the need for effective communication with sensitivity, for if it threatens it kills the needed support, of if it is not under-
stood it generates resistance. The innovation needs to be seen to improve practice and any new programme or proposal must be presented in such a way that it fits into the existing culture patterns; that alone is a challenge. The agents of change need to be selected for their prestige and status as opinion leaders; all this presents a formidable challenge and needs strategic and sensitive planning, with real understanding of the realities of practice. (We see some exciting glimmers of hope where joint appointments between nursing education and service are actually appearing, e.g. at the University of Manchester. This would appear to be an important step in bridging those gaps).

Finally the characteristics of the new programme are also pretty vital, particularly as seen by the potential adopters (Wasson 1960). It must be perceived as advantageous, compatible with existing practices and structures, and simple to understand and use. The idea must be communicable and to some extent divisible so that it can be tried out on a limited basis in a trial run. All this affects the rate of adoption. This may have some important messages for us in the future in service education of ward sisters. Perhaps we should look to them as our key agents of change and opinion leaders and seek to bridge some of the information gaps in that area.

## The way ahead

As I indicated at the beginning there is a range of useful and helpful literature on this subject. The difficulty which seems to remain is how do we solve the difficulties and improve on the implementation of innovatory ideas and programmes to contribute towards quality of nursing care? I see the most vital areas to consider as those of credibility, communicability practicability, acceptability and sensitivity. We are beginning to build up a body of knowledge. We also have a wide range of innovative courses and research findings, but we now have to forge the links that increase their implementation. No doubt it is possible to cite many individual examples of success in small areas but the great question remains-how can we contribute to the thinking of the statutory bodies in planning? It is true we have members there representing the interests of higher education and we have communication through the AIDCN conferences and standing conference; but these are infrequent events, we need stronger and perhaps more direct channels of communication - and then what are we going to communicate? The way forward could be channelled through a more efficient organization of our communication structure and a new assessment of our own potential contribution; and what better time and place to start than here and now.
