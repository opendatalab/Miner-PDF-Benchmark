#### Abstract

A B S T R A C T Sol-gel-derived porous carbon is an attractive electrode material for various applications because its structure, along with its physical properties, can be tailored to the specified task by selecting suitable precursors and synthesis conditions. To complement oil shale-based sol-gel materials, in the current study, the tunability of the properties of 5-methylresorcinol-formaldehyde (5MR-FA) carbon xerogel is examined. As expected, the porosity of the 5MR-FA carbon xerogel is lower than those of the corresponding carbon aerogels, but the specific surface area in the range of $2-417 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ and the electrical conductivity of $0.8 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{cm}$ demonstrate the potential of this xerogel in electrochemical applications as an electrode material. Furthermore, the synthesis conditions and final structure of the resulting carbon were in satisfactory correlation, including with the results of spectroscopy analysis. $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which is used as a catalyst in this sol-gel reaction, affects the structure of the resulting carbon. In this study, it was established that the oxidation level of carbon and the short-range structural order and disorder are also influenced by the amount of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which is supported by the trends in the electrical conductivity results.

## Introduction

The fabrication of porous materials via the sol-gel synthesis route has enabled the tuning of the structure and properties of the resulting materials via the selection of suitable concentrations of components in the precursor solution. The solid network that forms from the colloidal solution depends on the concentration of the precursor monomers and the solution $\mathrm{pH}[1]$, and this property has motivated numerous studies on tuning sol-gel-derived carbon materials for applications in energy conversion [2-4] and storage [5-8]. Sol-gel-derived microporous carbons in the form of carbon aerogels have enabled the realization of high specific surface areas of over $700 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$, which can be increased further if required $(\geq$ $3000 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}[9]$ ) by increasing the microporosity (IUPAC classification, pores with diameters of $<2 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) using physical or chemical activation $[9,10]$. The high microporosity of carbonaceous materials, however, is not always the primary feature when pursuing the best performance. For example, in battery electrodes, in the case of high microporosity, the initially increased specific capacitance[^0]

is accompanied by a large irreversible charge capacity upon cycling, and samples with electrodes from carbon with reduced microporosity have shown a more stable and higher reversible charge capacity instead [11,12]. The sparse structure of carbon can also result in reduced electrical conductivity of the material. Thus, in various scenarios, as an alternative to highly porous carbon aerogel fabrication, xerogel-type carbon can be an alternative material with more suitable properties and lower processing costs [13]. To produce an aerogel, a wet gel is dried out under supercritical conditions to maintain the highly porous structure of the gel, which often precedes a time-consuming solvent exchange step [8]. A xerogel is obtained by drying the gel directly at ambient temperature and pressure. Organic aerogels and xerogels are converted into carbon aerogels and carbon xerogels (CXs), respectively, via a process that is called pyrolysis, in which at high temperature in an inert atmosphere, carbon scaffold is formed due to leaving of heteroatoms and functional groups. Compared to the corresponding carbon aerogel, $\mathrm{CX}$ is denser and has a lower total pore volume [13].

The effects of the $\mathrm{pH}$ and the overall concentration of the sol on the structural properties of CX have been well studied for the resorcinol-formaldehyde system [14-16]. In a synthesis of

resorcinol-formaldehyde gel, the role of the alkaline catalyst, typically a weak base $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, is to deprotonate resorcinol promoting its reaction with formaldehyde. Further polycondensation leads to the formation of polymeric clusters. [1,17] The amount of catalyst determines the concentration of the clusters and the size to which the clusters grow until the gel forms: increasing catalyst concentration leads to higher cluster concentration, but smaller clusters and smaller pores between the clusters resulting in material with larger specific surface area. [16,18-20] Drying of such gels leads to larger shrinkage and higher density compared to gels with lower catalyst concentration. Overall concentration of the precursor solution affects the distance between these clusters. The larger the solvent volume, the more segregated are the clusters. Mass loss and shrinkage during the pyrolysis retain the trends that were achieved by tuning the sol composition. [14-16] CX has been demonstrated as an electrode material in electrochemical applications [3,6,21,22] and it shows substantial potential as an anode material in future $\mathrm{Na}$-ion batteries [6,23,24].

The current study explores the range in which the structure of 5MR-FA-based CX can be tailored. The 5-methylresorcinol that is used is derived from Estonian oil shale, which is currently locally an important source of energy. The fabrication of advanced carbon materials for energy storage technology would be an alternative application for oil shale with high added value. Systematic variation of the 5MR-FA gel composition and investigation of the properties of the corresponding CX samples were conducted to examine the controllability of the porosity, density, structural order and electrical conductivity of CX and expand the knowledge on sol-gelderived 5-methylresorcinol-based carbons beyond carbon aerogels [25].

## Materials and methods

## Carbon xerogel preparation

Carbon xerogel was synthesized via sol-gel polycondensation of 1,3-dihydroxy-5-methylbenzene (5-methylresorcinol, 5MR, $\geq 99.9 \%$, a product of VKG Oil AS, Estonia) and methanal (formaldehyde, FA, $35 \%$ aqueous solution, stabilized with $10 \%$ methanol, SigmaAldrich). $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ ( $\geq 99.8 \%$, Honeywell/Fluka) was used as a catalyst, and deionized water was used as a solvent. The concentrations of the catalyst and 5MR were varied systematically [26] (Table 1). $5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}$ refer to ratios of moles: $5 \mathrm{MR}$ to $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to 5MR, respectively. Moles of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ comprise water in $35 \%$ aqueous solution of FA. The molar ratio $5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{FA}$ was maintained at 0.5 . The samples are named according to corresponding molar ratios, with CX denoting carbon xerogel (Table 1).

A 5MR-FA gel was prepared as described in [27]. 5MR and $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ were dissolved in deionized water at $60{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Then, the solution was cooled to room temperature, namely, $25{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and the FA solution was added. After rapid thorough mixing, the solutions were cast into glass test tubes and left at room temperature for

gel formation. The gels formed from 5MR-FA solutions within $2.5 \mathrm{~h}$ depending on the molar ratios [25], except that with molar ratios $5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}=90$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=65$, which remained liquid and was not used in further experiments.

After 4 days of curing, the gel samples were removed from the test tubes and dried at room temperature and ambient pressure. After 3 days of drying under ambient conditions, the final moisture was removed under vacuum at $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ up to 2 mbar pressure, and an organic xerogel was obtained. The dried organic xerogel was ground using an agate mortar and pestle.

To obtain the carbon xerogel, the obtained organic xerogel powder was poured into a ceramic boat that was placed in a quartz tube, which was loaded into an MTF 12/38/400 tubular furnace (Carbolite). The pyrolysis was conducted in a flow $(0.025 \mathrm{l} / \mathrm{min})$ of $\mathrm{N}_{2}(\geq 99.999 \%$ ) according to a previously established pyrolysis programme [28] with a final temperature of $900{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (see Table 2).

After the end of the pyrolysis programme, the oven was allowed to cool to room temperature under its own thermal mass. At $400{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ flow through the furnace was turned off.

## Characterization of the carbon xerogel

The influence of the molar ratios on the morphology of the CX samples was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Helios NanoLab 600, FEI and TM-3000, Hitachi). The elemental composition was analysed using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (a Hitachi TM-3000 SEM that was coupled with a SwiftED 3000 EDX analyser, Oxford Instruments). The quantitative EDX analysis was conducted at magnifications of 500x and 1500x.

The porosity of the synthesized CX samples was investigated using $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ sorption analysis (KELVIN 1042 Sorptometer, Costech Microanalytical SC). $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ was selected as a probing gas to compare the results with previous $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ sorption results of aerogel-type carbon materials from 5MR-FA. Prior to measurements, the samples were outgassed at $100{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $8 \mathrm{~h}$. Helium was used as a carrier gas, and $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ (purity $99.999 \%$ ) was used as an adsorptive gas. $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ adsorption data were collected at relative pressures $\left(\mathrm{p} / \mathrm{p}^{0}\right)$ from 0.05 to 0.99 at the liquid $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ temperature of $-196.15{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The (apparent [29]) specific surface area $\left(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{BET}}\right)$ and total pore volume $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\text {tot }}\right)$ were calculated based on Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) theory, and the specific micropore volume $\left(V_{\text {mic }}\right)$ was determined via a t-plot. $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ sorption analyses were conducted for 3 batches of $\mathrm{CX}$ samples for verification.

Micro-Raman spectroscopy was used to assess differences in short-range structural order in the CX samples. The spectra were recorded from 100 to $3200 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ using a Renishaw inVia microRaman spectrometer with an $\mathrm{Ar}^{+}$laser at a wavelength of $514 \mathrm{~nm}$ at $100 \%$ laser intensity (approximately $10 \mathrm{~mW}$ ) for $10 \mathrm{~s}$. The instrument calibration was verified with a Raman signal of pure Si at $520 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. For numerical analysis of the first-order Raman spectra, the peak-deconvolution technique [30-32] was applied. Using the OriginPro 9 software, the spectra from 800 and $2000 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ were normalized and subjected to a 4-peak fit with 2 Lorentzian (D1

and $G$ bands) and 2 Gaussian (D2 and D3 bands) functions [33] on the corrected baseline. The intensity ratios of the $D$ band to the $\mathrm{G}$ band $(\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{D}) / \mathrm{I}(\mathrm{G})$ ) were calculated based on the peak heights [31]. Curve fitting in the case of disordered carbons is subject to high statistical uncertainty and depends on the selected functions [34], but comparison of similar samples using the same fitting strategy for each sample can reveal tendencies and trends in short-range order.

X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) of samples was performed on diffractometer SmartLab ${ }^{\text {TM }}$ (Rigaku, Japan) using a coordinate sensitive 1D detector D/teX Ultra and Cu rotating anode operated at $8.1 \mathrm{~kW}(45 \mathrm{kV}, 180 \mathrm{~mA})$. Diffraction pattern was measured between angles of 8 and $90^{\circ}$ with step size of $0.02^{\circ}(2 \theta)$ and scan speed of $4^{\circ} / \mathrm{min}$. Program PDXL (Rigaku) and ICDD database PDF2 (2015) were used for diffraction data, phase identification and fitting of peaks by symmetric a pseudo-Voigt peak shape function. Apparent crystallite size along basal planes (the lateral size, $L_{a}$ ) and size along the $c$ axis (the stacking height, $L_{c}$ ) were determined by using Scherrer formula

$L_{a / c}=K * \lambda /(F W H M * \cos (\vartheta))$,

where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of X-rays $(0.1540981 \mathrm{~nm})$, FWHM is the full width at half maximum of the peaks. The Bragg angle $\theta$ was $11.3^{\circ}$ and $21.9^{\circ}$, and the constant $K$ was 1.84 and 0.89 for calculation of $L_{a}$ and $L_{c}$, respectively. Interlayer spacing along $c$ axis $\left(d_{002}\right)$ was calculated from Bragg's law and average number of layers per a stack was calculated from

$<n_{\mathrm{s}}>=L_{c} / d_{002}$.

Standard reference material SRM-660 $\left(\mathrm{LaB}_{6}\right)$ was used for evaluation of instrumental broadening of diffraction reflections.

A cell for determining the density and electrical conductivity of the powders [35,36] was constructed (Fig. 1 a). Carbon powder was poured into a polymer cylinder between tightly fitting steel pistons with a diameter of $10 \mathrm{~mm}$. A weight of $100 \mathrm{~N}(1.25 \mathrm{MPa})$ was applied to the powder column. The corresponding pressure range has been proven to provide sufficient electric contacts in the particle bed without damaging its structure [35,37].

The electrical resistance of CX powder $\left(R_{2}\right)$ was determined at $2 \mathrm{~V}(U)$ in a voltage divider circuit (Fig. 1 b) by connecting the measurement cell filled with compressed CX powder (Fig. 1a, cell resistance $R_{2}$ ) in series with a $6.6 \Omega\left(R_{1}\right)$ resistor. The electrical conductivity of $\mathrm{CX}$ was calculated as a reciprocal of the electrical resistivity (Eq. 3):

$\sigma=l /\left(R_{2} * A\right)$,

The density of the compressed CX powder was determined by dividing the mass of the carbon powder in the cell by its volume. The density and electrical conductivity were measured using a carbon xerogel powder with a grain size of $\leq 200 \mu \mathrm{m}$. The average result of 5-7 measurements for 3 batches is presented for each CX with the standard deviation.

## Results

Porosity

The morphology of 5MR-FA CX depends on the synthesis parameters in the same way as in 5MR-FA carbon aerogels [25], but the structure of CX appears to be denser with fewer voids between the particles that form the structure, according to the SEM analysis (Fig. 2). The higher the catalyst concentration and the lower the solvent concentration, the denser the structure.

The total pore volume, micropore volume and specific surface area according to the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ sorption analysis are low if the catalyst concentration in the precursor solution is high $\left(5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}=30\right.$ ) (Table 3). In the carbon aerogels, the microporous structure was preserved due to supercritical drying, and a specific surface area that exceeded $100 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ could be obtained at the same precursor concentrations [26]. Lowering the catalyst concentration and the overall concentration of the starting sol, the average specific surface area and the pore volume of 5MR-FA CX can be as high as $417 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ and $417 \mathrm{~mm}^{3} / \mathrm{g}$, respectively (Table 3 ), while the pore volume of one representative sample of CX-90-45 reached $520 \mathrm{~mm}^{3} / \mathrm{g}$; this finding is astonishingly similar to the properties of the 5MR-FA carbon aerogels, which reached a specific surface area of $590 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ [38], a total pore volume of $640 \mathrm{~mm}^{3} / \mathrm{g}$ and a micropore volume of $120 \mathrm{~mm}^{3} / \mathrm{g}$ [39]. The linear $\mathrm{p} / \mathrm{p}^{0}$ range of the BET plot that was used in the calculations was $0.05-0.20$.

Carbon xerogel samples with larger specific surface areas have distinctive Type IVa isotherms (Supplementary materials, Fig. S1) with hysteresis (IUPAC classification [29]). Sharp step-down of the desorption branch occurs between relative pressure values $\left(\mathrm{p} / \mathrm{p}^{0}\right)$ of $0.4-0.5$, which is characteristic of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and indicates the presence of small mesopores (pores with diameters of 2-50 nm). In some cases, the shift to 0.7 can be explained by the larger pore size. The sorption is limited due to the absence of macropores (pores with diameter of $>50 \mathrm{~nm}$ ), and the isotherms remain horizontal in the upper range of $\mathrm{p} / \mathrm{p}^{0}$. The total pore volume $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\text {tot }}\right)$ can be derived from the amount of vapour that is adsorbed at a relative pressure that is close to unity (e.g., $\mathrm{p} / \mathrm{p}^{0}=0.95$ ).

The isotherms of samples CX-30-45 and CX-30-65 are reversible and characteristic of nonporous or macroporous materials (Type II isotherms). Near $\mathrm{p} / \mathrm{p}^{0}=1$, the adsorption limit is not reached, and the total pore volume cannot be correctly determined. Near $\mathrm{p} / \mathrm{p}^{0}=1$, the isotherm is vertical also for low-surface-area sam-

ples CX-30-25 and CX-60-25. A low-pressure hysteresis loop corresponds to the irreversible uptake of adsorbate molecules in adsorbent pores that are of the same size as the adsorbate molecules. Therefore, for these two samples, the $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{BET}}$ value can be inaccurate.

The correlations between the total porosity, specific surface area (Table 3) and the sample density are clearly identified (Fig. 3 a, b and c), along with the correlation between the density and catalyst concentration in the precursor solution-the lower the $5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ ratio, the higher the density of $\mathrm{CX}$. Comparing the influence of the precursor solution concentration on the final density of the carbon xerogel, for $5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}=60$ and 90 , a higher $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}$ ratio leads to a lower density; at $5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}=30$, the influence is marginal.

As expected, the density of $\mathrm{CX}$ is much higher than the density of the corresponding carbon aerogel [25] (Fig. 3), but the correlation between the density and the catalyst concentration, along with the precursor solution concentration, is more pronounced for the 5MR-FA carbon xerogel. Thus, tailoring the 5MR-FA carbon xerogel in terms of density and porosity is straightforward, which can be an advantage compared to tailoring carbon aerogels. However, in contrast to 5MR-FA carbon aerogels, monolithic carbon xerogel samples could not be obtained due to capillary forces breaking the gel structure during water evaporation under ambient conditions.

gel. The elemental compositions of the samples are presented in Table 4. The correlation between the $\mathrm{Na}$ and $\mathrm{O}$ weight percentages is linear (Fig. S2), but the total percentage of measured oxygen in CX is divided between $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ and the carbon structure. After subtracting the $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ contribution from the EDX results, the oxygen concentration in $\mathrm{CX}$ remains higher in the case of a higher $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration: the maximum $\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{C}$ is 0.27 (CX-3025) (Table 4). Hence, $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ hinders the graphitization of $\mathrm{CX}$ and the removal of oxygen from the xerogel structure. Compared to oxidized graphite ( $\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{C}$ is 0.47 ) [40]), the oxygen level in 5MR-FA CX is significantly lower; compared to resorcinol-based CX, the oxy-

gen content in 5MR-FA CX samples is higher. Resorcinol-based CX consists of $\geq 95 \%$ of carbon [41] after pyrolysis at $700{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, but in the latter, roughly an order of magnitude lower catalyst concentration in the starting solution compared to 5MR-CX allowed to expect that result. The trend of increased oxygen content in CX in the case of increased carbonate concentration has been explained by the activation effect of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that is produced by decomposition of carbonate during pyrolysis, and which reacts with carbon structure forming various oxygen species. [42] The presence of oxygen in the carbon structure is favourable when further functionalization is targeted. Metallic impurities that originate from catalysts in the final carbon material can be avoided by selecting organic catalysts for adjusting the $\mathrm{pH}$ of the precursor solution $[9,43]$. Under the applied synthesis conditions, $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ remains in the final carbon material [44] and contributes to the physical properties of $\mathrm{CX}$, as will be shown hereinafter.

At high catalyst concentrations $\left(5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}=30\right)$ and high overall concentrations $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=25\right), \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is not distributed homogeneously in CX. Needle-like crystals that were rich in $\mathrm{Na}$ and $O$ were observed in SEM images and an elemental mapping of $\mathrm{CX}-30-25$ - the areas of $\mathrm{Na}$ and $\mathrm{O}$ on the elemental map overlap (Fig. 4). At lower $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentrations, the distributions of $\mathrm{Na}$ and $\mathrm{O}$ atoms on the material grains became successively more uniform, and in the element mapping of CX-90-45, no needle-like crystals were observed (Fig. S3). The presence of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ crystals and hindering effect of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ on graphitization aligns with the mechanism of carbothermic decomposition of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$. [45,46]

## Structural order

Resorcinol-based sol-gel-derived carbon aerogels and xerogels are amorphous [47,48]. While structural ordering of such carbons can be influenced by the pyrolysis temperature and heteroatoms, graphitization can occur at temperatures below $1000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ only in the presence of graphitization catalysts [47,48]. Thus, layered graphitic structures in 5MR-FA CX are unlikely. The short-range structural order of 5MR-FA CX samples in terms of carbon-carbon bonding was investigated using micro-Raman spectroscopy. We have shown in previous work [49] that carbon particles that are prepared from 5MR-FA colloidal solution using a lower $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration than in this study $\left(5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}=120\right)$ and a low overall concentration $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=90\right)$ give a single band at $1580 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ in the Raman spectrum, which is characteristic of monocrystalline graphite. The Raman spectra of 5MR-FA CX (Fig. 5) have features of nanocrystalline and amorphous carbons [30,31], and the spectra are similar to those of activated carbons [30], soot [34], carbon black [50] and graphene oxide (GO) [50,51], which all show a higher G band intensity than the $\mathrm{D}$ band intensity and a distinctive $2^{\text {nd }}$-order spectrum.

In Raman spectra of amorphous carbon, D and $G$ bands at $1346 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ and $1585 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, respectively, are characteristic. The $G$ mode involves the in-plane bond-stretching motion (vibration mode of $\mathrm{E}_{2 \mathrm{~g}}$ symmetry) of pairs of $\mathrm{sp}^{2}$ carbon atoms in aromatic and olefinic molecules [31]. The disorder-induced D band is related to the $A_{1 g}$ breathing mode [31]. In the case of perfectly ordered graphite, in the first-order Raman spectrum, only a sharp $\mathrm{G}$ band can be observed, but with an increase in the amounts of defects and disorder in the carbon structure, the apparent G band broadens, and additional bands develop in the spectrum. [34,50,52-54] A second-order spectrum of CX samples in the range of approximately $2300-3200 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ represents a combination of 2 broad bands. A well-defined 2D band (a second-order D band) at $\sim 2700 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ is always present in graphite with large crystals. [54] In ordered graphite samples, the 2D band provides information regarding the order in the third dimension and the stacking of graphitic layers [55-57]. The appearance of the 2D band together with the $\mathrm{D}$ band in the spectrum has been explained by the presence of small graphitic crystal particles [58]. The band

Raman spectra of synthesized $5 M R-F A C X$ samples, which are grouped as a) $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=25$, b) $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=45$, c) $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=65$, and d) $5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}=60$. The spectra are normalized according to the G-band intensity.

at $\sim 2900 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ is associated with the $\mathrm{D}+\mathrm{D}^{\prime}$ band, which is induced by disorder [33,54]. In ordered carbon materials with only a few defects, another defect-related band ( $D^{\prime}$ ) can be observed at $\sim 1620 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ [34,52,56,59-61], but in highly disordered carbons, the D' band, which may merge with the $G$ band, has not been observed [59,61], and it was not observed in the spectra of the 5MR-FA CX samples either.

For every considered $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}$ ratio (Fig. $5 \mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b}, \mathrm{c}$ ), reducing the catalyst concentration reduces the widths of the $\mathrm{D}$ and $\mathrm{G}$ bands. In the case of disordered $\mathrm{sp}^{2}$ carbons, the $\mathrm{D}$ and $\mathrm{G}$ bands are broad, as is the whole second-order Raman spectrum. Narrowing of the bands is a sign of higher order in the carbon structure [58,62]. In all samples, the intensity of the $G$ band $(I(G))$ is substantially higher than the intensity of the D band (I(D)) (Fig. 5). This appears to be an effect of drying the gel under ambient conditions [22,63-65] because such a pattern is not typically observed in Raman spectra (514 $\mathrm{nm}$ laser wavelength) of resorcinolformaldehyde-based low-density carbon aerogels [66,67]. A study by Zhang et al. showed that even in the case of graphene oxideresorcinol-formaldehyde composites, the intensity of the $D$ band remains higher than that of the $G$ band [66]. The $D$ and $G$ band locations in the spectra of all synthesized CX samples coincide. At equal $5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ ratios, the depth of the valley between the $\mathrm{D}$ and $G$ bands of the Raman spectra is similar among the samples (Fig. $5 \mathrm{~d}$ ); thus, the overall concentration of the precursor solution has less effect on the order of the CX structure than the concentration of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$.

To extract additional numerical information from the firstorder Raman spectra of the CX samples, 4 functions were fitted $[30,31,34,60-62]$ without fixing or limiting the range of any spectral parameter in the iteration process (deconvolved Raman spectra are presented in Fig. S4). In addition to the apparent G band at $\sim 1585 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, the $\mathrm{D}$ band was fitted by a narrow D1 band at $\sim 1350 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ and a broad D2 subband at the same wavenumber. At $\sim 1550 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, a D3 band was identified. The fitting parameters are summarized in Table 5. The fitting algorithm did not identify the D' band at $1620 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, which supports the argument that the 5MR-FA CX samples have disordered structures with only small crystallites.
Fitting of the $\mathrm{D}$ band in the case of disordered carbons is a large source of inaccuracy, and the D band position and its intensity depend on the functions that are used [31]. Fitting the D band by a primary narrow D1 band and a broad D2 subband has previously been justified by the processes of single and double scattering, respectively, of the photoelectrons by the domain edge, which is responsible for the D band occurrence [32]. The probability of such double resonance decreases with the growth of the crystallite domain size ( $\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{a}}$ limit $\sim 5 \mathrm{~nm}$ ), thereby suggesting that the investigated CX samples are nanocrystalline. The intensity of the D band, I(D), is the sum of the intensities of the D1 (I(D1)) and D2 (I(D2)) bands [32] (Eq. 4).

$I(D)=I(D 1)+I(D 2)$

The Raman shifts of the D1, D2 and G bands for the analysed samples vary only slightly (the standard deviation in Table 5 is less than $2 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ ). The $\mathrm{G}$ band shifts towards lower values as the oxygen concentration in the sample increases (except for CX-30-25). In the case of graphite, the increase in the level of oxidation shifts the $\mathrm{G}$ band maximum towards higher Raman shift values. [40,68] Hence, we conclude that the synthesized CX samples are of higher disorder than graphite oxides: in the case of amorphous carbons, the position change of the $G$ band towards a lower wavenumber (along with an increase in the $\mathrm{G}$ band width; Fig. 5) corresponds to an increase in disorder but can also correspond to a change in the size of aromatic domains [33]. Nevertheless, the Raman shift of the $\mathrm{G}$ band at $\sim 1590 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ (as low as $1520 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ for amorphous carbons depending on the state of disorder [31]) and relatively narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) correspond to the presence of short-range order within CX samples [33].

The increase in the $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration decreases the intensities of the D1 and G bands and increases the intensities of the D2 and D3 bands (Fig. 6). In the sum spectra, this translates to wider apparent D and G bands with a less steep "valley" between the bands (Fig. 5). The correlation between the intensities of the bands and the oxygen percentage in CX is almost linear (Fig. 6), except in the case of $\mathrm{CX}-30-25$, which has the highest $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration ( $21 \% \mathrm{O}$ in $\mathrm{CX})$. The deviation is likely related to the presence of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ crystals, as observed via SEM (Fig. 4). When part

of the $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is in the form of needle-like crystals, the amount of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ that homogeneously spreads within $\mathrm{CX}$ is lower, and the overall effect of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ on $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bonding is smaller. The intensities of D1, G, D2 and D3 of CX-30-25 closely match the corresponding intensities of CX-60-25 with $11.5 \%$ O in CX.

The intensity of the D3 band at $1500-1550 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, which corresponds to a vibration mode that is detected in amorphous carbons [34], has been found to correlate with the level of oxygen content in graphene oxide [60]. In soot, the I(D3)/I(G) ratio has been related to the proportion of amorphous carbon [34]. Plotting the I(D3)/I(G) of 5MR-FA CX samples against the oxygen concentration (Fig. 7), an almost linear correlation is observed in the 0 range of $9-15 \%$, which well accords with those studies.

The intensity ratio of the $D$ band to the $G$ band is often used to calculate the size of crystallites, but in addition to crystallite size $[31,32,54,69,70]$, the Raman response depends strongly on the amount of heteroatoms [70]; therefore, crystallite sizes will not be calculated for the CX samples in this study. The intensity ratio of the $D$ band to the $G$ band $(I(D) / I(G))$ characterizes the disorder in carbon materials. For the 5MR-FA CX samples, $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{D}) / \mathrm{I}(\mathrm{G})$ increases approximately linearly with the oxygen concentration in the CX sample (Fig. 8).

Following Ferrari's and Robertson's three-stage model [31,55], with the $\mathrm{G}$ band position at $\sim 1590 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, the increase in the $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{D}) / \mathrm{I}(\mathrm{G})$ ratio can be interpreted as graphitic carbon developing nanocrystalline features and becoming less ordered or partially amorphous carbon developing nanocrystalline features and becoming more crystalline as the $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration is increased. According to that model, the $G$ band would shift towards higher wavenumbers in both cases. The $\mathrm{G}$ band at $1580 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ in the Ra-

man spectrum of 5MR-FA-based carbon nanoparticles with much lower $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration ( $5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}=120, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=90$ ) and monocrystalline graphitic structures [49] suggests that an increase in the $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration (CX samples) induces disorder. The position of the G band of individual CX samples appears to shift towards lower wavenumbers (Table 5) with increasing $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration, but in the model [31,55], the $\mathrm{G}$ band was fitted by a single function, while in the present study, the G band was fitted by the $G$ and $D 3$ bands.

When calculating $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{D}) / \mathrm{I}(\mathrm{G})$ ratios from the raw Raman spectra (Fig. 8), the trend remains similar to that in the fitted results. The values in the range of $0.82-0.95$ exceed those for amorphous and tetragonal amorphous carbons with high $\mathrm{sp}^{3}$ contents due to their crystallinity.

An additional view to crystallinity of samples was obtained from XRD analysis of CX samples. In Fig. 9, XRD patterns of CX30-45 and CX-90-25 are presented. The patterns of both of the samples exhibit high background intensity and three weak and broad reflections, called hereafter as bands, at diffraction angles $2 \theta=22.6^{\circ}, 43.8^{\circ}$ and $79.6^{\circ}$, whereas the third band was barely visible. These bands can be explained by the presence of stacked graphitic layers in the CX samples. The profiles of each of the observed bands for both of these samples was well characterized by a single symmetric peak shape function (pseudo-Voigt, residual errors $R_{w p}=3-4 \%, R_{\text {expected }}=1.2-1.7 \%$ ). The first band, located at $d=0.3917 \mathrm{~nm}$, was positioned between $\gamma$ and $\Pi$ bands. The $\gamma$ band ( $\left.d_{\gamma}=0.444 \mathrm{~nm}\right)$ represents the packing distance of saturated structures such as aliphatic side chains and the $\Pi$ band (denoted also as (002) band, $d_{002}=0.3355 \mathrm{~nm}$ for crystalline graphite) reflects the spacing of aromatic ring layers in carbon materials [71-73].
Absence or undetectably low concentration of saturated aliphatic side chain structures in these samples could explain the symmetric shape of the first band and its assignment to the $\Pi$ band. Since the broadening and position of the $\Pi$ band considerably depends on the distortion factors of carbon atoms located at the aromatic ring layers [74], the observed shift of this band towards higher distance values compared to the position of this band in crystalline graphite refers to a defective structure of these samples. The CX samples, according to the classification method that uses positioning of carbon materials in an order/disorder scale based on the values of $d_{002}$, belong to the range of disordered carbon materials $\left(d_{002}>0.35 \mathrm{~nm}\right)$ [75]. The second and the third bands, arising from hexagonal ring structure of graphite, are located close to the 100, 101 and 110 reflections of graphite, respectively. These bands are often denoted as (10) and (110) or (11) [76].

Structural parameters of the sample CX-30-45, calculated from the position and broadening of the first two bands, are the following: $L_{c}=0.80(4) \mathrm{nm}, L_{a}=2.6(2) \mathrm{nm}, d_{002}=0.392 \mathrm{~nm},<n_{s}>=2$. The parameters of the sample CX-90-25 are: $L_{c}=0.90(4) \mathrm{nm}$, $L_{a}=3.1(2) \mathrm{nm}, d_{002}=0.394 \mathrm{~nm},<n_{s}>=2$. These results suggest that the crystallites of CX samples are composed of about two stacked graphitic layers that are separated, on an average, by $0.393 \mathrm{~nm}$. Distortions in the positions of carbon atoms and the small size of the graphite like structures in the samples are probably the reason why about a $17 \%$ increase of this distance, compared to that for crystalline graphite, was observed. The sample CX-30-45 showed a bit lower crystallinity compared to that of the sample CX-90-25 agreeing with the conclusions drawn based on the Raman spectra.

## Electrical conductivity

The correlation between the structural order and the abundance of $\mathrm{sp}^{2}$-conjugated carbon domains in $\mathrm{CX}$ was further assessed by comparing the electrical conductivity of the CX samples. The electrical conductivity was the highest for samples CX-90-25, CX-90-45 and CX-60-65 and reached $0.8 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{cm}$ in the latter case. When the $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{D}) / \mathrm{I}(\mathrm{G})$ intensity ratio increases, the electrical conductivity of the sample decreases (Fig. $10 \mathrm{a}$ and d, b and e, c and f). The correlation between the electrical conductivity and the intensity ratio is not as straightforward as those between the carbon and oxygen percentages in the CX samples and the Raman fitting parameters, but in the case of similar overall concentration (equal $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}$ molar ratios), the same trend can be observed. This demonstrates that increasing the $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration in the sol increases the disorder in $\mathrm{CX}$, and the grains of the more ordered structure become less ordered. This result coincides with the conclusions that were based on the $G$ band locations of the samples on Raman spectra fitted curves and with the findings regarding resorcinol-based carbon xerogel [22]. Compared to the electrical conductivities of pristine sol-gel-derived monolithic low-density carbon aerogel (ap-

Plots a) and d) correspond to $C X$ with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=25$, b) and e) to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=45$, c) and f) to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=65$.

proximately $5 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{cm}[77,78]$ ) and carbon xerogel powders from the literature $(0.05-0.3 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{cm}[22], 1.1 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{cm}[79]$ in the composition with $10 \%$ binder), the $0.2-0.8 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{cm}$ that was realized in this study is a competitive result for the application of 5MR-FA CX as an electrode material.

The density of CX (Fig. 3) is inversely correlated with the electrical conductivity of the sample. Typically, a higher material density results in a higher electrical conductivity. [35,77,80] Regarding the electrical conductivity of sol-gel-derived 5MR-FA CX powders, a higher density is accompanied by a higher level of oxygen in $\mathrm{CX}$ and a higher concentration of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which is not electrically conductive. As a result, the higher the density is, the lower the electrical conductivity of the 5MR-FA CX sample. As expected, the electrical conductivity is correlated with the percentage of carbon in CX (Fig. 10).

However, sample CX-60-45 has lower electrical conductivity than anticipated based on the $I(D) / I(G)$ ratio and the carbon percentage in the sample. The higher intensity of the $\mathrm{D}+\mathrm{D}^{\prime}$ region and the less pronounced 2D band in the Raman spectrum of CX-6045 (Fig. 5 b) correspond to higher disorder [56] compared to other samples from the $\mathrm{CX}$ series with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=45$, which explains this behaviour. The cause of this structural difference remains unexplained, but the same molar ratios enabled us to obtain 5MR-FA carbon aerogels of the lowest density [25].

A study by Fung et al. showed that the electrical conductivity for activated carbon fibres is more sensitive to the specific surface area of the samples than the parameters of the Raman spectra [81]. The 5MR-FA CX samples enable the preparation of powders with low and reasonably high specific surface area with a wide range of electrical conductivities. Due to the gradual variability of the CX structure and the consistency of the Raman spectra, 5MR-FA CX has substantial potential as a model material for various applications.

## Conclusions

The results of this study vividly demonstrate the potential of sol-gel-derived 5MR-FA carbon xerogel due to its adjustable structure and properties. The morphology of $\mathrm{CX}$ can be efficiently controlled over a broad range, as demonstrated by $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ sorption analy- sis, SEM, density measurements, XRD and elemental analysis, and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, due to the direct correlations between the oxygen content in the CX structure and the density, porosity, specific surface area, electrical conductivity and degree of ordering in the carbonaceous structure, this xerogel is attractive as a model system for fundamental studies, except if the $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration is too high, in which case the results deviate from the trend due to the presence of segregated needle-like $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ crystals in the $\mathrm{CX}$ structure. The specific surface area in the range of 2-417 m $\mathrm{m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ and the electrical conductivity of $0.8 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{cm}$ demonstrate the potential of the xerogel as an electrode material in electrochemical applications, such as energy storage. The level of oxidation suggests possibilities for material functionalization.

Compared to 5MR-FA carbon aerogels, as expected, the corresponding CX samples are less porous, especially in terms of microporosity, but structural features such as higher density, lower specific surface area and concurrent higher structural short-range order enable broadening of the utilization of oil shale-derived 5MR to the fabrication of custom designed technological materials with added value for energy applications. With this, facile production compared to aerogels is an important advantage.
