In memory of Eric Derouane Metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) have attracted a great deal of attention owing to their potential in a wide range of current and future applications in fields as diverse as medicine,[1] sensors,[2]
optics[3] and catalysis.[4] We have recently reported various protocols for the preparation of supported metallic nanoparticles on a range of supports such as metal oxides,[5] biopolymers[6]
and mesoporous materials.[7, 8] Different approaches were investigated including impregnation, co-precipitation, sonication and microwave-assisted synthesis to achieve an understanding of the formation and the control of the sizes and shapes of the nanoparticles. In particular, the microwave-assisted synthesis was found to overcome inherent drawbacks of the unsupported nanoparticles with regards to stability, agglomeration and reusability as well as the use of reductants, allowing an efficient and greener method to obtain highly active and well-dispersed supported MNPs (Au, Ag, Pd and Ru).[8] Compared to these extensively investigated transition and noble metals, iron-based catalysts are inexpensive, environmentally benign and relatively non-toxic. Iron compounds are also abundant and biocompatible, playing a vital role in many biological systems,[9] and are becoming increasingly important in environmentally friendly catalytic protocols.[10] With regards to catalysis, supported MNPs display a large surface to volume ratio as compared to their bulk metal analogues which makes them attractive candidates as catalysts for a wide range of reactions including hydroisomerisations,[7] hydrogenations,[11] CC coupling[5, 6, 12] and oxidations.[13, 14]
The oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds is one of the key transformations in synthetic organic chemistry.[15] Alternative systems have been developed based on greener oxidants, including hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen, as well as heterogeneous catalysts such as Fe2O3 nanoparticles,[13]
Ag-NPs supported on hydrotalcites,[14] Au-NPs supported on metal oxides[16] and Pd-NPs supported on SBA-15.[17]
Following our microwave-assisted approach, we report the preparation of highly active and stable supported Fe-NPs on a

range of supports and their catalytic activities in the oxidation of alcohols under microwave irradiation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of directly prepared and catalytically active low-loaded supported Fe-NPs.

Si-MCM-41 was synthesized according to our previously reported methodology.[18] Commercial microporous carbon
(DARCO) was used as purchased. Starch and cellulose were employed as nonporous supports for comparison. The supported Fe-NPs were prepared under microwave irradiation as follows: The support (0.2 g) was suspended in EtOH (2 mL)
containing 100 mg of the iron precursor (iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate, FeCl2·4H2O), and the mixture was heated in a microwave at 200 W for 15 min (average temperature 1008C, maximum temperature 1208C). The solids were then filtered off, washed with excess ethanol and acetone and dried overnight at 100 8C to afford red-orange fine powders. The properties of the supported MNPs are summarised in Table 1. The Fe loading on the materials was found to be very low, typically between 0.3 and 0.35 wt% (Table 1), although no significant differences in loading were found between the porous and the nonporous materials.

Fe/MCM-41 exhibited identical surface area and pore sizes to the parent support MCM-41 (Table 1, Figure 1). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Fe/MCM-41 show that the incorporation of the Fe-NPs did not remarkably alter the structure of the porous solids (Table 1, Figure 1, Supporting Information). Interestingly, over 98% of the Fe content corresponds to Fe0, as determined by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and only traces of iron oxide, in good agreement with the results obtained from wide-angle XRD studies, in which no diffraction lines corresponding to iron oxide were found (Figure 1).

![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)

The successful preparation of Fe-NPs was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Figure 2) and UV/Vis spectroscopy (Figure 3). TEM micrographs show the presence of highly dispersed MNPs with varying particle sizes, which depend on the support (Table 1). A bimodal nanoparticle size distribution was clearly observed for Fe/MCM-41 with average nanoparticle sizes of 8 and 21 nm (Figure 2 A). Fe/starch exhibited smaller and homogeneously distributed Fe-NPs without appreciable formation of Fe aggregates (Table 1, Figure 2 C),
while small but non-uniformly distributed iron particles were present on cellulose (Table 1, Figure 2D). Interestingly, large Fe clusters (100–150 nm) were found on the carbonaceous support, affecting the catalytic performance (see discussion with

![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)

Figure 4).

The bimodal distribution of Fe-NPs is in good agreement with the two broad bands appearing in the 250–300 nm range and the shoulder at 500–550 nm in the UV/Vis spectra
(Figure 2, left). Bands appearing in the 200–300 nm range have been correlated to the charge transfer between Fe d electrons and oxygen p orbitals on the mesoporous surface.[19] The presence of bands at wavelengths greater than 400 nm has been associated with iron oxide clusters and/or iron aggregates.[20]
Santhosh Kumar et al. reported that bulk iron oxide exhibits absorption bands in the 400–600 nm range.[21] Nevertheless, the wide-angle XRD patterns of the supported Fe-NPs
(Figure 1, inset) confirmed the absence of the characteristic diffraction lines of iron oxides. Thus, the shoulder at 500–550 nm may be attributed to the Fe-NP aggregates (ca. 21 nm) found in the materials as similarly reported for Ag-NPs on silica.[22]
The absence of this shoulder in the samples of Fe-NPs supported on nonporous biopolymers indicates the absence of significant nanoparticle aggregation on such materials, in good agreement with the TEM results (Figure 3).

Fe2+ is a relatively difficult cation to reduce to Fe0. Its aqueous standard reduction potential (0.4089 V) is lower than those for other ions used to prepared metallic nanoparticles, such as Ru2+ (0.45 V), Pd2+ (0.98 V) or Ag+ (0.79 V).[8] However, the formation of Fe-NPs mediated by EtOH indicates that the reduction of Fe2+ to Fe0 is facilitated with the higher energy of the microwave radiation. Fast and uniform microwave-assisted heating can be achieved by the use of polar solvents (e.g.

EtOH) and supports (hydroxyl-rich surfaces).[23] The surface hydroxyl groups have also been reported to play an important role in the reduction process through binding of the metal ion in solution (before reduction) and thus favouring the nucleation of nanoparticles at the mesoporous surfaces.[22, 24]
The difference in size of the prepared Fe-NPs depends on the nature of the support. Biopolymers with an accessible and continuous hydroxyl-rich surface are able to bind Fe2+ ions in solution, and thus the reduction and nucleation of nanoparticles under microwave irradiation (dipolar OH groups are good microwave absorbers) generates small metallic nanoparticles with a narrow particle size distribution (Figure 3, right).

Mesoporous supports including MCM-41 and silica have a localized and non-uniform distribution of hydroxyl groups on the surface, with silanol groups due to the presence of siloxane bonds SiOSi in the materials. The binding and subsequent reduction, nucleation and growth of the Fe-NPs take place on the scattered surface hydroxyl groups in the materials therefore leading to a low loading of the MNP, in good agreement with previously reported results.[24] The observation of localized Fe aggregates (Figure 2 A) indicates that the nucleation of the Fe-NPs takes place on neighbouring hydroxyl domains and/or on the external surface of the mesoporous material, where initially deposited particles act as seeds to facilitate the growth and formation of larger metal clusters.

Iron supported on microporous carbon with a graphite-like structure exhibited comparable metal loadings to hydroxyl-rich 2008   747

![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)

supports. However, the observation of large clusters on the microporous carbon also implies that the agglomeration of the MNPs on the external surface takes place to a further extent compared to Fe/MCM-41 owing to the absence of anchoring hydroxyl groups, which interact with the metal ions in solution.

Such interaction between the support and the nanoparticles and the proposed stabilisation of the Fe-NPs through the hydroxyl groups is further supported by the performance of the MNPs in catalytic processes. The activity of the supported FeNPs was investigated in the liquid-phase oxidation of various alcohols with hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. The oxidation of benzyl alcohol was initially performed at 70 8C over 48 h using an excess of H2O2 as the test reaction. No significant conversion of starting material was found regardless of the catalyst utilized in the reaction. Compared to conventionally heated reactions, microwave-irradiation protocols have been reported to reduce reaction times from hours to minutes and enhance reaction rates and selectivity to the targeted product.[23] The oxidation of benzyl alcohol was consequently carried out under microwave irradiation employing various supported iron materials. The results are summarised in Table 2. Blank runs in the absence of catalyst did not give any appreciable conversion of the starting material in any of the investigated reactions. Interestingly, the hydroxyl-rich support materials including starch, cellulose and MCM-41 exhibited good turnover numbers
(TONs) and excellent selectivities to benzaldehyde, with Fe/
starch being slightly more active than Fe/MCM-41 and Fe/cellulose. Only traces of benzoic acid as by-product were observed and determined by GC-MS. The H2O2 efficiency (calculated as the number of moles of product per consumed H2O2L
100%) was found to be between 20 and 70% (Table 2 and Table 3), depending on the catalyst and the substrates employed in the reaction.

To prove the truly heterogeneous nature of our catalysts under the reaction conditions, the catalysts were filtered off after 1 h of reaction time in the presence of microwave. The used catalyst was charged in a microwave tube with fresh reagents (0.2 g substrate, 4 mmol H2O2, 2 mLacetonitrile), and the mixture was irradiated in the microwave for 1 h. Similarly, the filtrate obtained after the reaction (without the catalyst)
with freshly added reagents was also reacted for an additional 1 h. Interestingly, different behaviours were observed for the catalysts depending on the nature of the support employed for the preparation of the Fe-NPs.

Mesoporous Fe/MCM-41 was found to be highly reusable in the reaction; its activity was preserved and it displayed complete selectivity to the targeted product after three consecutive reactions (Figure 4). Furthermore, no noticeable increase in conversion (after 1 h microwave irradiation with fresh reagents)
was obtained for the liquid filtrate obtained from the first reaction after the catalyst was filtered off. These results are in good agreement with ICP analyses, which revealed only traces of Fe (<0.5 ppm) in solution after the reaction. Microporous carbon supported Fe gave much lower activities, which may be

correlated to the large clusters observed in the materials, and it was found to completely deactivate after two consecutive reactions (Figure 4). Large metallic nanoparticle clusters have been reported to display inferior activities compared to small, dispersed metal nanoparticles in several catalytic applications.[25]
On the other hand, nonporous Fe/starch and Fe/cellulose materials were found to be unstable under the reaction conditions. Fe/starch could not be recycled, as a viscous gel was obtained in solution after the reaction probably as a result of decomposition and degradation of the starch under the reaction conditions (hydrogen peroxide and 708C microwave heating).

ICP analysis of the reaction mixture revealed a high content of Fe in solution, implying that the higher activity of the supported catalyst might be due to a homogeneously catalyzed reaction. Fe/cellulose could be recycled, but the activity of the reused catalyst was significantly reduced after 1 h of microwave reaction (Figure 4) and an increased amount of Fe
(>40 ppm) was found in the mixture after reaction. We believe that H2O2 under microwave conditions degraded the polysaccharide structures and oxidized the Fe-NPs, giving rise to Fe species, which were then leached into the solution. On the

![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)

other hand, the mesoporous MCM-41 material was stable under the reaction conditions, preserving both its activity and structure as confirmed by XRD
(Supporting Information).

Encouraged by the promising results in terms of activity and reusability obtained for the Fe/ MCM-41 material, we tested a range of alcohols in the oxidation process (Table 3). Under microwave irradiation, Fe/MCM-41 exhibited high activities in the oxidation of benzyl alcohols but lower activities towards less-activated substrates such as cyclohexanol and 1-octanol. Almost complete selectivity to the targeted product (aldehydes or ketones) was found regardless of the substrate employed
(Table 3). Our results with supported metallic iron nanoparticles are a clear improvement on reported protocols for the oxidation of alcohols,[13, 17] providing exceedingly higher TONs as well as much reduced reaction times (from 8–24 h to a maximum of 1 h) with nearly identical conversions and selectivities to those reported using conventional heating.

In summary, we have prepared highly active and selective supported iron metallic nanoparticles on a range of porous and nonporous supports and studied their catalytic behaviour in the oxidation of various alcohols under microwave irradiation using hydrogen peroxide as green oxidant. In general, the results can be clearly improved and refined for further applications in organic chemistry. However, we believe that these supported systems can greatly contribute to the development of active and selective supported materials for continuous processes owing to their reusability, availability, ease of preparation and low cost, as well as promote the green credentials of future protocols in terms of sustainability and environmentally friendliness (Table 3). Further investigations are currently ongoing to improve these results and test other substrates as well as to implement our protocol to other catalytic reactions.

## Experimental Section

Si-MCM-41 was prepared according to previously reported methods.[18] Commercial microporous carbon (DARCO), high amylose corn starch (Hylon VII, National Starch Food Innovation) and cellulose (Sigma, cellulose fibrous medium) were used as purchased. A
typical preparation of the supported iron catalysts was performed as follows: MCM-41 (0.2 g) was suspended in EtOH (2 mL) containing FeCl2·4H2O (100 mg), and the mixture was heated in a microwave at 200 W for 15 min (average temperature 1008C, 1208C
maximum temperature reached). The solids were then filtered off, washed with an excess of ethanol and acetone and dried overnight at 1008C. The red-orangish powders were characterised by means of several techniques including XRD, nitrogen physisorption, TEM
and UV/Vis spectroscopy.

Oxidation reactions under microwave irradiation were carried out in a Microwave CEM-DISCOVER reactor with PC control and monitored by sampling aliquots of reaction mixture that were subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/
GC-MS) using an Agilent 6890N GC model equipped with a 7683B
series autosampler fitted with a DB-5 capillary column and an FID
detector. Experiments were conducted on a closed vessel (pressure controlled) under continuous stirring. The microwave method was generally power controlled. The samples were microwave-irradiated (200 W power output), and different temperatures ranging from 70 to 90 8C were reached depending on the reaction and/or the catalyst. The reaction products were also identified and confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy using a JEOL400 spectrometer operating at 400.13 MHz. Chemical shifts were calibrated using the internal SiMe4 resonance. Plasma ICP analyses were carried out on a PerkinElmer 40 instrument.

A typical catalytic test was performed as follows: A mixture of benzyl alcohol (0.2 g, 1.85 mmol), H2O2 (0.4 mL, 4 mmol), acetonitrile (2 mL) and catalyst (0.05 g) was heated in a microwave at 200 W (70 8C) for 1 h. The response factors of the main reaction products were determined with respect to the starting materials from GC analysis using known compounds in calibration mixtures of specified compositions.
