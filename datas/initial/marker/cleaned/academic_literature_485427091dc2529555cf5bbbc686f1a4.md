Reflectance spectra indicate that the samples have high-purity color mainly in the yellow region and that the color is due to interference oscillations in the visible range. In addition, reflectance data in conjunction with composition–depth profiles obtained using glow discharge spectrometry indicate that the coloration of the samples is due not only to reflectance oscillations but also to the subtraction effect. The reduced Fe content and significant oxygen content in the near-surface region attest to the formation of a mixed oxide layer. Atomic-force microscopy examination indicates that the sample surface has an island structure.

## 1 Introduction

The coloring of metals is used in architectural and industrial applications for both functional and decorative purposes (e.g., the INCO process developed for stainless steel by Evans *et al.* [1]). There are several methods of coloring stainless steel, including heat treatment and/or thermal oxidation [2, 3], electrolytic oxidation [4], and chemical oxidation [5, 6]. On the other hand, sol–gel-derived coatings produced with metal alkoxides and HCl or HNO3 as catalysts are used to protect stainless steel from oxidizing atmospheres at high temperatures [7].

The mechanism by which a colored film grows on stainless steel immersed in a hot solution of chromic and sulfuric acids is well understood [8–14]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) results [10, 12, 13] demonstrate that, both in the current pulse method with the use of a hot 2.5 M CrO3 + 5 M H2SO4 solution and in immersion treatment, the coloring process involves anodic and cathodic reactions in the microcell on a stainless-steel substrate. The former reaction is responsible for anodic dissolution of the three major metallic components Fe, Ni, and Cr, as represented by the general scheme M =
Mn+ + ne. The cathodic reaction is responsible for oxide film growth owing to the hydrolysis of metal ions, leading to the formation of simple metal oxides and/or mixed metal oxides. The reactants are believed to come from the solution. Using AES, Lin and Duh [12] assessed the elemental concentration profiles in colored 1 The article was translated by the authors.

films produced by the current pulse method on SUS304 stainless steel. According to their results, the oxygen content increases from the stainless steel substrate toward the film surface, while the Fe content decreases.

Stoychev *et al.* [14] used XPS to determine the chemical composition of colored films produced by immersion (chemical) treatment. They assumed based on their results that the color was associated with the variations in the thickness of the oxide layer formed and in the concentration of Fe and Cr oxides. Other groups focused on the corrosion characteristics of colored films produced by chemical INCO [15], the mechanical characteristics of colored films grown on stainless steel by the current pulse method [16], and the thermal performance of austenitic stainless steel solar absorber plates colored by chemical and thermal oxidation techniques [17].

In this paper, we report an attempt to separately assess the contributions to coloring from interference and color subtraction using chemical analysis by glow discharge spectrometry (GDS), in conjunction with reflectance and interference studies.

## Experimental

AISI 304 stainless steel plates 2.5 mm in thickness were cut into square samples 2.5 cm2 in area, which were then polished to mirror finish (mean surface roughness of 0.3 µm). Next, the samples were degreased in a hot alkaline solution and cleaned in acetone under sonication. Coloring was carried out in an electrolytic cell with a platinum electrode (100 mV, 60 Hz). The steel sample served as the working electrode.





The solution, a mixture of 5 M sulfuric acid and 2.5 M chromic acid, was kept at a constant temperature of 70°C with slow stirring to ensure laminar flow at the electrode surface. The samples were immersed in the solution, and a voltage of 100 mV was applied for 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 min. In the case of shorter times (less than 10 min), the surface was not colored. At longer times (over 30 min.), severe corrosion took place, eroding the steel. The coloration, green with violet spots throughout, was typically not very vivid. The surface morphology of the films was examined by atomic-force microscopy (AFM).

tion conditions were 700 V, 20 mA, and an argon pressure of 7 × 102 Pa. The pressure in the spectrometer was 10–3 Pa (turbo molecular pump, rotation speed of 9 ×
104 rpm), and that in the glow discharge lamp was 3 Pa.

Sputtering with argon ions causes sample erosion with an average rate of 1.84 µm/min in a spot 4 mm in diameter. Deexcitation of the removed atoms gives rise to emission at characteristic wavelengths, which is detected by photomultipliers, one for each element (for some elements, e.g., iron and nickel, two detectors are used). In this way, all the elements are probed simultaneously.

Reflectance spectra were measured on a spectrometer with coupled deuterium and tungsten–halogen lamps, spanning the range 190 to 1600 nm (IR through UV). Illumination and detection were done with the same optical fiber at near normal incidence of the light beam owing to the smooth surface.

Quantitative depth profiles (QDPs) of most of the elements in the films were obtained with a LECO glow discharge–optical emission spectrometer. The opera-

with slight deviations which had no effect on the general behavior—only the data for 30 min are presented.

Table 1 also gives the chemical composition (wt %)
of the layer determined by GDS at 15-, 50-, and 200-nm depths. The data illustrate the variation in the concentrations of the major constituents of the alloy and impurities originating from the solution.

The profiles in Fig. 1 show that the oxygen and chromium contents decrease from the film surface toward the stainless steel substrate, while the iron and nickel contents increase, indicating that the film surface and stainless steel substrate differ markedly in composition. Therefore, to estimate the thickness of the layer, we assume that the interface corresponds to the steepest slope of the Fe profile (~75 nm).

As expected, the chromium and sulfur contents increase toward the film surface since they come from the chromic and sulfuric acids (in agreement with previous observations [12]); the oxygen concentration also increases. In light of this, we expect the formation of some oxides and/or mixed metal oxides, depending on the oxygen concentration and the distance from the substrate. It also seems likely that, as a result of the anodic dissolution, a large amount of iron removed from the substrate remains suspended or precipitated in the acid solution, which, unfortunately, reduces the efficiency of the coloring process.

The high oxygen content near the film surface and the absence of oxygen in the substrate attest to the formation of oxides and other oxygen-containing species in the film. The nickel and manganese concentrations decrease slightly from the substrate toward the film surface.

Figure 1b shows the depth profile in terms of the number of atoms per gram of the sample. In contrast to



the data in Fig. 1a, low-Z atoms (carbon, nitrogen and oxygen) have significant intensities, comparable to those of heavier atoms (chromium, iron, and nickel). From such plots, one can gain valuable information about the nominal concentrations of impurities, analyzing the shape of the spectra or comparing the oxygen required for the formation of particular compounds with the total oxygen content. For example, in a porous pure silica film on a metallic substrate, the number density of oxygen atoms is twice that of silicon atoms. In this work, the film (~75 nm) contained a high concentration of oxygen, presumably in the form of metal oxides.

Interference colors on stainless steel. The samples obtained through the described treatment showed a uniform coloration, attributable to interference phenomena, which depended on the treatment time and the thickness of the film.

The reflectance spectra of the samples are shown in Fig 2a. In analyzing the spectra, we take that an interference maximum is observed when [19]

$$d=(2m+1)\lambda/4n,$$
d = (2m + 1)λ/4n, (1)
where d is the optical thickness, λ is the wavelength, n is the refractive index of the film, and m is an integer
(order of interference). In the case of minima,

$$d=m\lambda/2n.$$
d = mλ/2n. (2)
The optical thickness d does not always coincide with the film thickness and depends on the angle of incidence, characteristic of interference coloring.

Table 2 shows the experimental wavelengths obtained for the maxima and minima in the reflectance of the samples analyzed, the film thickness d estimated from the Fe depth profile, thickness dcalc that gives the best fit to the number of maxima and minima, the order of interference m, and the refractive index n needed to adjust the wavelength to the experimental value. Lower values of m correspond to longer wavelengths.

As seen in Fig. 2a, the maxima and minima become weaker and narrower as the wavelength decreases.

Given that m is the number of attempts for the light beam to leave the layer, one must take into account that the optical path increases with m, reducing the signal through absorption. On the other hand, the frequency of interference oscillations increases toward the UV, where the absorption is rather high. Our calculations included the UV region.

Figure 2b shows the calculated refractive indices that adjust the wavelength to the experimental value according to Eqs. (1) and (2). In the range 300–800 nm, the data correspond to a mixture of Cr2O3 and Fe2O3 [20].

$\eqref{eq:walpha}$. 



At longer wavelengths, ncalc drops sharply, which may be related to the characteristics of the layer, experimental uncertainty, or misinterpretation of the data.

Table 3 lists the tristimulus values (X, Y, Z), chromaticity coordinates (x, y), corresponding dominant wavelength, percent purity, and CIE 1976 (L*a*b*) color parameters [21, 22] for five samples. In addition, Fig. 3 shows the chromaticity diagram indicating the corresponding points for five samples. The values for our samples fall within the area bounded by the solid curve, which is the locus for the colors in the visible region. Thus, the samples have a real color composed of its spectral components. Furthermore, since the data points lie above the dashed lines, the colors of the samples can be considered a mixture of white light
(point C) and monochromatic light with the wavelength λ indicated in Table 3. Color purity is the ratio of the distance between point C and the point representing the color of the sample to the distance between point C and the point representing the dominant wavelength λ
(Fig. 3). Our samples had high purity values in the yellow (560–590 nm) and orange (590–630 nm) spectral regions. Nevertheless, the spectra of all the samples, except for the one treated for 10 min, show two maxima in the visible range, which are responsible for the color of the samples.

Although the color of the stainless steel samples is obviously dominated by the interference phenomena governed by the thickness of the layer, the contribution of color subtraction cannot be ruled out. It is well known that some of the absorption bands of the ions and metals used here [22, 23] coincide with the minima in reflectance. Given that Fe and Cr are widely used in pigments and dyes, where typical concentrations of these elements are close to those in our samples, we believe that these species also contribute to the color of the samples through the subtraction effect.

Surface morphology of colored layers. The AFM
images in Fig. 4 illustrate the surface morphology of the samples treated for 10 and 20 min. The former sample differs very little in roughness from the untreated substrate. By contrast, treatment for 20 min produces drastic changes in surface microstructure, there are well-defined steel grain boundaries, and the austenite grains are seen to have an island structure, in accordance with earlier reports [14]. The likely explanation for these changes is that the grain boundaries undergo anodic dissolution and that the austenite grains act as active centers where cathodic reaction takes place, resulting in film growth.

## Conclusions

Stainless steel was colored by an electrolytic method
(60 Hz, 100 mV) with five different treatment times.

Quantitative depth profiles obtained with GDS show reduced Fe content and high oxygen content in the near-surface region, attesting to the formation of an oxide layer. In addition, the surface layer contains increased concentrations of chromium and sulfur, which originate from the chromic and sulfuric acids used in our preparations. The concentrations of the other elements present in stainless steel 304 are lower in the surface layer compared to the film bulk.

The origin of the color was inferred from reflectance spectra. The observed reflectance oscillations were attributed to interference phenomena. The tristimulus values, CIE 1976 (L*a*b*) color parameters, chromaticity coordinates, corresponding dominant wavelength and percent purity were evaluated for five samples processed under different conditions. The positions of the samples in the chromaticity diagram suggest that their color is a mixture of white light and monochromatic light with the dominant wavelength. The high purity color values, mainly in the yellow region, are due to two maxima in the visible. Moreover, Fe and Cr also contribute to the color of the samples through the subtraction effect.

AFM images showed an island structure which is likely to result from anodic dissolution at grain boundaries and cathodic reaction on austenite grains.
