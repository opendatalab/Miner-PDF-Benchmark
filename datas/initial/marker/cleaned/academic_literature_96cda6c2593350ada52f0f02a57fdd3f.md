Vavilova 38, Moscow, 119991 Russia e-mail: avgusta@kapella.gpi.ru Received December 25, 2003; in final form, June 30, 2004 Abstract—The properties of AgCl1 - xBrx (x = 0.5–0.8) solid solutions prepared by the Bridgman–Stockbarger method are studied using a variety of techniques (x-ray diffraction, microstructural examination, chemical analysis, and x-ray microanalysis). The lattice parameter of the solid solutions is found to exhibit a negative deviation from additivity. The effects of composition and preparation conditions on the structural properties of the solid solutions are discussed. The structural characteristics of abrasively polished surfaces of the samples are shown to be influenced by the preparation conditions.

## Introduction

AgCl1 - xBrx (x = 0.5–0.8) solid solutions are of considerable technological interest as candidate materials for polycrystalline infrared (4–16 µm) fibers [1]. Optical fibers produced by extrusion of AgCl1 - xBrx crystals with x  0.7 (composition corresponding to the minimum liquidus temperature) are known to possess better mechanical and optical properties compared to fibers fabricated from AgCl and AgBr [2, 3].

The structure of polycrystalline fibers has only been studied in relation to their optical properties [1, 4–6]. No data have been reported on the structural properties of AgCl1 - xBrx crystals and the relationship between the properties of the solid solutions and those of the polycrystalline fibers produced from them.

This led us to investigate the effect of growth and annealing conditions on the structure and properties of AgCl1 - xBrx crystals with 0.5 < x < 0.8.

## Experimental

AgCl1 - xBrx solid solutions (NaCl structure, sp. gr.

Fm3m) are known to exist over the entire composition range [7].

AgCl and AgBr were prepared by precipitation from a silver nitrate solution, followed by washing and drying. The resultant salts were purified to remove decomposition products, water, organics, and ionic impurities, using filtration, zone melting, vacuum distillation, and directional solidification. The compositions of the starting mixtures were 75 wt % AgBr + 25 wt % AgCl (composition KRS-13) and 50 wt % AgBr + 50 wt % AgCl
(composition KRS-11). The mixtures were melted in a halogenation atmosphere with vigorous stirring, followed by directional solidification. After melt filtration through a capillary and vacuum distillation, directional solidification was repeated in the same ampule [8].

AgCl1 - xBrx solid solutions were prepared by vertical directional solidification (Bridgman–Stockbarger process) without seeding.

The crystals were grown in a vertical two-zone furnace. The ampule was lowered at a rate of 2 mm/h from the hot zone (50–60°C above the melting point of the material) to the cold zone (300–350°C). The temperature gradient at the solidification interface was 10–
25°C, depending on the temperature profile. After the completion of solidification, the drive system was shut off, and the crystal was annealed during cooling at 10 to 15°C/h.

The ingots thus prepared were 18 mm in diameter, 70 to 100 mm in length (after cutting off the end portions, up to 40% of the ingot length), and 100 to 150 g in weight. The faces of the ingots were lapped in several steps, with M28, M20, M14, and M5 electrocorundum powders, and then polished with commercial Polirit to optical finish. The 10.6-µm absorption coefficient of the ingots, determined by laser calorimetry [9], was
(1−3) × 10–4 cm–1.

The composition of the solid solutions was checked by amperometric titration with silver nitrate, by taking averages over five repeated measurements [10]. The



scatter in the analytical data was within 1.5 wt % AgBr. The compositional nonuniformity was within 2 wt %
over the entire crystal length. The AgBr content of the solid solutions varied from 70 to 83 wt % (30 to 17 wt %
AgCl, x = 0.65–0.80) in KRS-13 samples and from 52 to 58 wt % (48 to 42 wt % AgCl, x = 0.50–0.55) in KRS-11. The inhomogeneity of the crystals resulted from compositional changes during the purification of the growth charge [8], which included repeated directional solidification.

The density of the crystals was determined by the Archimedes method using extrapure-grade toluene or OSCh 13-5 isopropanol as the buoyancy fluid. As reference samples, we used optical-quality germanium crystals weighing 120 and 10 g, which was close to the weights of the as-grown crystals and the samples for investigation. Each density value was the average of three repeated measurements and was corrected for the measurement temperature. The reproducibility of the data was 0.005 g/cm3 for crystals 100 to 150 g in weight and 0.01 g/cm3 for samples 8–12 g in weight. The density of the KRS-13 samples was 6.12–6.24 g/cm3, and that of KRS-11 was 5.96–6.03 g/cm3. The plot of density versus composition (chemical analysis data) for the solid solutions shows a slight negative deviation from linearity (Fig. 1a). The scatter in the density data is most significant around x  0.7 (minimum in the liquidus).

Optical examination (MBS-1 microscope) of the faces of the KRS-13 and KRS-11 ingots after selective etching in aqueous 20% sodium thiosulfate for 30 s revealed macroblocks ranging in size from 1 to 10 mm.

In x-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, we used diskshaped samples 18 mm in diameter and 3 mm in thickness, cut perpendicular to the ingot axis (misorientation within 0.2°) from the end and middle portions of the ingots. Intensity data were collected on a DRON-3M
automatic diffractometer in the 2θ range 26°–136°
(CuKα radiation, diffracted-beam monochromator, step scan mode with a counting time of 5 s per data point and a scan step of 0.05°). After abrasive polishing and etching from one side (etched surface), the sample was mounted in the holder with its faces parallel to the holder plane. All preparation steps and XRD measurements were made under identical conditions.

The intensity data set was reduced using the PROFILE FITTING V 4.0 program [11]. The peaks were fitted by a modified Voigt function with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) = 8.0. To reduce the effect of preferential orientation, the sample was rotated during intensity measurements.

Qualitative phase analysis of the samples was carried out with the use of PCPDFWIN data. Some of the samples were found to contain AgBr impurity.

Lattice parameters were evaluated by least squares refinements, using α-Al2O3 powder with a =
4.7588(1) Å and c = 12.992(2) Å (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA) as an external standard. The composition of AgCl1 - xBrx solid solutions was evaluated by the additivity rule, using the formulas a = 1.5027 + 2.1795rX and rX = 1.96x + 1.81(1 - x),
where a is the lattice parameter of the solid solution, rBr = 1.96 Å, and rCl = 1.81 Å (we use Shannon's radii [12] and the lattice parameters aAgCl = 5.549 Å and aAgBr = 5.774 Å from Swanson *et al.* [13]). The lattice parameter of the KRS-13 samples was found to lie in the range a = 5.679–5.706 Å, which corresponds to x =
0.72–0.79, in agreement with chemical analysis data. The plot of the lattice parameter versus composition
(chemical analysis data) for the solid solutions is displayed in Fig. 1b.

The crystal structure of one of the samples was determined by Rietveld analysis using DBWS-9411
[14]. As the main model in preferential-orientation calculations, we used the March–Dollase function: Pk =
[ cos2αk + (1/G2)sin2αk]–3/2, where G1 and G2 G are fit- 1 2



ting parameters, and αk is the angle between the scattering vector and the texture axis. Peak asymmetry was evaluated for 2θ ≤ 40°. The FWHM of the XRD peaks in the range 2θ = 26°–136° was 0.1°–0.5° for all of the polycrystalline samples, oriented or not.

After refining the scale factor, zero counter position, background, lattice parameters, and sample displacement, the profile parameters were refined successively.

Next, we refined the isotropic thermal parameters together with site occupancies separately for each atom.

## Results And Discussion

Below, we analyze XRD patterns taken from the etched surfaces of the samples.

Figure 2a shows the XRD pattern of AgCl, which demonstrates that the sample is polycrystalline: of the 16 reflections possible in the 2θ range studied, the XRD
pattern shows 14. According to calculations, the 200 reflection from polycrystalline AgCl must be about twice as strong as the 220 reflection: I200/I220  2. We obtained I200/I220  1. Moreover, the relative intensities of the 200 and 220 reflections were found to depend on whether the sample was rotated or not, which attests to preferential orientation of the crystallites along the The XRD pattern of AgBr (Fig. 2b) points to the presence of both crystalline and amorphous phases, in the ratio of about 40 : 60. In the 2θ range studied, we detected only five reflections, of which 220 was the strongest, I200/I220  0.01. This also attests to 〈110〉 preferential orientation, which is stronger compared to AgCl.

The lattice parameter of our AgCl sample, a =
5.5480(9) Å, agrees well with that reported in the literature, a = 5.549 Å [13]. The lattice parameter of AgBr was variously reported as 5.774, 5.755, and 5.740 Å
[13, 15, 16]. The value obtained in this work, a =
5.766(4) Å, lies between the reported lattice parameters of AgBr. The scatter in the data may be due to the influence of structural defects, probably those in the Br site.

The AgCl1 - xBrx samples studied can be divided into eight types (Fig. 3), according to their XRD patterns. Figure 3 displays typical XRD patterns of the KRS-13 ingots.

Type 1 (Fig. 3a). The XRD patterns of those samples showed no diffraction peaks, which was due to the strong misorientation of all the crystallographic planes relative to the sample surface. The XRD pattern of a ground sample showed 12 reflections out of the



   2005





16 reflections possible in the 2θ range studied
(I200/I220  1), indicating that the sample was crystalline.

Type 2 (Fig. 3b). The sample was amorphous, as evidenced by the broad halo in its XRD pattern.

After annealing at 200°C in air for 3 h, followed by cooling to room temperature over a period of 4 h, the XRD pattern showed two reflections, 200 and 220, with I200/I220  6 (Fig. 3c). Presumably, the samples of this type were misoriented, similar to type 2, and, in addition, contained an amorphous component. Also possible is that annealing under the specified conditions lead to crystallization.

Type 3 (Fig. 3d). The samples consisted of both amorphous and crystalline components. Annealing increased the degree of crystallinity in these samples (Fig. 3e).

Some of the samples in this group consisted of two distinct macroblocks and cleaved readily along the interface between them. XRD examination revealed that the blocks differed in structure:
1. One macroblock consisted of both amorphous and crystalline components, with I200/I220  1; the other macroblock was fully crystalline, but with a different orientation of crystallographic planes: I222/I111  1.5.

Note that the blocks differed very little in composition, as evidenced by their lattice parameters being identical (to within the error of determination).

2. One block was polycrystalline, with randomly oriented crystallites and I200/I220  2.36; the other block had a well-defined [113] preferential orientation. Such blocks differed in lattice parameter: a = 5.661(9) and 5.684(5) Å. Moreover, the blocks were more difficult to separate by cleaving in comparison with the above sample.

Etching of polished cross sections also revealed macroblocks differing in crystallographic orientation. The etch pattern in Fig. 4 clearly shows the boundary between the blocks, which are seen to differ markedly in etching behavior. Typically, the macroblocks in the two end portions of the ingot were arranged in a similar manner.

Type 4 (Fig. 3f). The sample was polycrystalline: its XRD pattern showed 12 reflections out of the 16 possible ones (I200/I220  3). The composition of the AgCl0.271(3)Br0.729 solid solution, evaluated from its lattice parameter (a = 5.686 Å) by the additivity rule, was then refined by the Rietveld method [14]. The result can be represented as AgCl0.372Br0.628(6), which points to a positive deviation of the lattice parameter from additivity.

At the same time, the Rietveld analysis results can be interpreted as attesting to a halogen-deficient solid solution of composition AgCl0.116(5)Br0.7480.138, with a negative deviation from additivity. The R-factors (Rp =
8.5%, Rwp = 10.6%, RB = 7.9%, RF = 10.4%) in the two models differed insignificantly.

According to chemical analysis data, the sample composition was 74.0 ± 1.0 wt % AgBr + 26 wt %
AgCl, or AgCl0.315Br0.685. The molecular weight Mmeas evaluated from the measured density (ρ = 6.125 ±
0.01 g/cm3) and lattice parameter (a = 5.686 Å) of the sample using the formula ρ = MZ/V (where Z = 4 is the number of formula units per unit cell and V is the unitcell volume in Å3) is 169.58, which is well below the Mcalc = 173.98 calculated for the composition AgCl0.315Br0.685 . Therefore, either the chlorine content of the sample was higher (ACl < ABr, where A is the atomic weight) than that determined by chemical analysis (the composition deduced from Mmeas is AgCl0.41Br0.59) or the sample contained anion vacancies. For example, the composition inferred from Mmeas with allowance made for anion vacancies is AgCl0.30Br0.640.06 or AgCl0.12Br0.720.16. In the former case, the anion composition is close to that determined by chemical analysis (note that chemical analysis gives no way of determining site occupancies); in the latter, the composition is close to that inferred from Rietveld refinement. Thus, the solid solution is likely to contain anion vacancies for two reasons: because of the possible presence of vacancies in the parent AgBr and because of the negative deviation from additivity, which fits well with the data in Fig. 1, confirmed by calculations (Mmeas < Mcalc).

Etching the surfaces of the type 4 samples revealed macroblocks, which were easy to separate by cleaving.

The macroblocks within a given sample differed in lattice parameter, e.g., a = 5.681(2) and 5.690(1) Å, which was due to composition differences: AgCl0.29(1)Br0.71 and AgCl0.26(1)Br0.74, respectively (see also type 3). This gave rise to internal stress, resulting in easy cleavage.

For some of the samples, we observed a shift of XRD peaks due to the internal stress, which led to a poor convergence in refining the lattice parameter.

After annealing at 200°C in air for 3 h, followed by cooling to room temperature over a period of 4 h, the XRD patterns of those samples showed well-resolved
- doublets, and the scatter in lattice parameters was notably smaller, indicating that the system was brought to equilibrium.

The shift of diffraction peaks may be due to macroscopic and microscopic (oriented) stresses. The latter arise from block boundaries, consisting of dislocation networks, which determine the difference in strain between the block boundaries and neighboring blocks. Microscopic stresses cause all of the XRD peaks to shift in the direction corresponding to the bulk stress, whereas macroscopic stresses shift only some of the peaks. Our experimental data attest to the presence of the two types of stresses. Note that the samples differed significantly in the width of diffraction peaks, which is, most likely, associated with microscopic stresses.

Additional evidence for the presence of stresses is that the samples cracked when subjected to thermal or mechanical treatment. It seems likely that the stresses were due to both the insufficient postgrowth annealing of the samples and the presence of macroblocks differing in crystallographic orientation.

Type 5 (Fig. 3g). The crystallites in those samples were oriented along [111] (threefold axis): their XRD patterns showed only two reflections, 111 and 222, with I111/I222  13.

Type 6 (Fig. 3h). The XRD pattern showed three reflections: 200, 113, and 226. The strongest reflections were 113 and 226, with I113/I226  4, which was due to
[113] preferential orientation (in the m plane).

Type 7 (Fig. 3i). The crystallites were oriented predominantly along [100] (fourfold axis): the XRD pattern showed h00 reflections with h = 2, 4, and 6 (the strongest reflection was 200) and also the 113 and 226 reflections.

Type 8 (Fig. 3j). The sample had [110] preferential orientation (along the twofold axis), as evidenced by the very high intensity of the 220 reflection in its XRD pattern.

Thus, XRD analysis of the etched surfaces of AgCl1 - xBrx samples revealed both amorphous and crystalline components. The crystalline samples differed in the degree of crystallinity, crystallite orientation (random or preferential along [100], [110], [111],
or [113]), and the nature and magnitude of stress. In some cases, individual macroblocks differed in composition, as evidenced by the difference in lattice parameter exceeding the standard deviation.

We also examined the as-cut faces of the samples
(after cutting on a lathe). XRD analysis showed that the damaged layer was polycrystalline, with no amorphous component (type 4).

The present results indicate that cutting and abrasive treatment of AgCl1 - xBrx samples give rise to elastic and plastic strains, similar to what occurs in solid solutions between thallium halides. The plasticity of thallium and silver halides governs the formation of the damaged layer. In the case of thallium halides, the thickness of this layer depends on the crystallographic orientation of the sample, the nature of the abrasive, the applied load, and the original microstructure (block size) of the sample [17, 18].

Abrasive treatment of some of the KRS-11 and KRS-13 samples either gives rise to partial amorphization (types 2 and 3) or alters the crystallographic orientation of the surface layer, leading to the disappearance of diffraction peaks (type 1). The main mechanism of plastic deformation is slip, resulting in displacement of one part of the crystal relative to the other, which may, in particular, alter the orientation of the deformed region [19, 20]. One manifestation of diffusion plasticity is the deformation of solid solutions associated with the motion of point defects (substitutional impurities, vacancies, and others), which may lead to "amorphization" of individual crystallographic planes.

The XRD patterns from individual blocks in type 3 samples indicate that amorphization may occur within a single block, independent of its crystallographic orientation, which rules out the effect of the treatment procedure and suggests that amorphization is governed by structural defects in such blocks, similar to what was reported for thallium halides [17, 18]. The XRD patterns from some of the samples showed a limited number of reflections, attesting to a significant texture
(types 5–8). The presence of stresses in crystals and individual blocks seems to be one of the factors governing the nature and thickness of the damaged layer.

Thus, the diffraction pattern from the etched surface of AgCl1 - xBrx samples depends on their microstructure
(the macro- and microblock sizes, orientation, stress level, and others), which, in turn, depend on the preparation conditions.

At a low thermal gradient in the growth furnace (10–
15°C/cm), the solidification interface is situated above the diaphragm separating the hot and cold zones of the furnace and is flat or slightly convex toward the melt. This shape of the solidification interface is preferable for growing KRS-13 crystals consisting of a small number of macroblocks and is the most stable for x > 0.7.

At a steep gradient (20–25°C/cm), the solidification interface is situated in the lower zone and is concave, which increases the number and misorientation of blocks. At the end of each growth run, after 70–80% of the melt solidified, the thermal gradient in the furnace was raised in order to stabilize the position of the solidification interface, because an increase in heat removal along the solidified portion of the ingot and a reduction in heat supply from above owing to the ampule lowering to the cold zone led to a rapid rise in growth rate, impurity trapping, and pore formation. Additional heating of the upper zone stabilizes the growth rate but increases the stress in the tail end of the ingot. The initial position of the ampule and the weight and composition of the growth charge also influence the position and shape of the solidification interface throughout the growth process; thus, the defect density and stress level in the grown crystal depend on a wide variety of factors.

The structural properties of the etched AgCl1 - xBrx samples depend, to some extent, on their composition:
polycrystalline solid solutions without preferential orientation (type 4) had x = 0.5–0.7, while the samples with x > 0.7 were typically textured (types 5–8), with composition-independent preferential orientation. This distinction can be interpreted in terms of the location of the sample composition relative to the minimum in the liquidus curve and, accordingly, in terms of the shape of the solidification interface for samples grown under identical conditions but differing in composition.

## Conclusions

The lattice parameter of AgCl1 - xBrx solid solutions with x = 0.5–0.8 shows a negative deviation from additivity due to anion vacancies.

The disk-shaped samples studied in this work can be divided into eight types, according to the XRD patterns of their etched surfaces: misoriented, amorphous, polycrystalline, and preferentially oriented with [100],
[110], [111], and [113] axial textures. The partial or complete amorphization of the surface layer during abrasive treatment of the solid solutions is due to the presence of stresses and structural defects in the parent crystals, related to the particular thermal conditions of crystal growth.
