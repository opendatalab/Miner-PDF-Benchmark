## 1 Introduction

Zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film is an important II–VI oxide compound which has recently received much attention. ZnO has a wide range of properties that depend on doping including a range of conductivity from metallic to insulating, high optical transparency, a direct wide band gap semiconductivity
(3.3 eV at room temperature), and a large exciton binding energy (60 meV) [1]. On the other hand, diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) are obtained by randomly substituting a fraction of cations by magnetic elements such as transition metals (TMs), e.g., Mn, which introduces magnetic properties to the host semiconductor. DMSs can provide a viable route to establish spin-polarized current injection into a standard nonmagnetic semiconductor. DMSs may show different magnetic phases such as ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or paramagnetic, which are normally different from the host materials. These behaviors are attributed to the interaction between the spins of the carriers and the localized moments of TM impurities [2, 3]. It has also been shown that some DMSs have Curie temperatures at or above room temperature when the hole density is sufficiently high in the compound [4].

TM-doped ZnO semiconductors are a highly promising DMS candidate for applications in spintronics at or above room temperature [5–9]. Doping TM elements at the Zn cation sites introduces carriers to the system. It has been suggested that the observed ferromagnetism in this material is related to the interstitial zinc and oxygen vacancies in ZnO
[10]. Therefore, these systems have the potential for technological applications due to their coexisting magnetic and semiconducting properties.

ZnO thin films can be deposited by various growth techniques such as chemical vapor deposition, reactive and ionassisted evaporation, spray pyrolysis, and sol–gel. It has been found that physical properties of zinc oxide depend on the growth method and environmental conditions such as temperature, pressure, and also doping concentration. Crystal structure can also affect the optical properties. According to the published results, the magnetic properties of pure ZnO and TM-doped ZnO thin films also show dependence of magnetic properties on the technique used to grow the films. Apart from doping, the effects of sample preparation conditions on their properties have to be considered. In the sol–gel method, environment parameters affect properties of the films during the growth of samples [11].

In this work, Mn- and Ni-doped ZnO thin films were grown using the dip sol–gel method, and subsequently the structural, optical, and magnetic properties of the films were investigated. Concentration of the TM elements in all samples was kept at about 3%.

## 2 Experimental Details

The pure and TM-doped ZnO thin films under investigation were grown by the dip sol–gel method. Zinc acetate dehydrate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O], manganese acetate dehydrate
[Mn(CH3COO)2·2H2O], and nickel chloride [NiCl2·2H2O]
were used as the zinc, manganese, and nickel sources, respectively, and 2-mithoxyethanol (DME) [C3H8O2] and monoethanolamine (MEA) [C2H7NO] were used as the solvent and stabilizer, respectively. All chemicals were prepared from Merck. Zinc acetate and the dopant were dissolved in a mixture of DME and MEA solution at room temperature. The molar ratios of MEA to Zn2+ and TM to Zn were maintained at 1% and 3%, respectively. The solution was vigorously stirred at 70 °C for 1 h using a magnetic stirrer to yield a clear and homogeneous solution, and then held Fig. 1 XRD patterns of the



films: ZnO:Mn, ZnO, ZnO:Ni at room temperature for about 24 h to receive the desirable sol before deposition onto clean glass substrates. After deposition, the films were dried at 200 °C for 20 min to evaporate the solvent and organic residuals. The deposition procedure was repeated seven times. The films were finally annealed at 500 °C for 1 h in an open air furnace. Undoped ZnO films were also prepared in the same way.

The optical, magnetic, and structural properties of the films were characterized by various techniques. An X-ray diffractometer (Brucker AXS model) with CuKα radiation line (λ = 1.5406 Å) was used to investigate the crystallite phase and orientation of the films. The diffractometer was adjusted from 30° to 70° with scan step of 0.02°. A Nanosurf model atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to study the surface morphology of the films. Optical transmittance was recorded at room temperature using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 100 model) with a 2 nm slit
(accuracy 0.1%). Optical constants of the films, refractive index, and extinction coefficient were calculated using the pointwise unconstrained minimization algorithm [12]. Hysteresis loops of the films were recorded by the quantum design PPMS. During the magnetic measurements, the field was applied along the surface of the films. Typical thickness of the films was about 300 nm. All the measurements were conducted at room temperature.

## 3 Results And Discussion

Figure 1 shows the room temperature X-ray diffraction patterns of the annealed samples. The XRD patterns indicate that all the TM-doped and pure ZnO films are single phase.

No trace of Mn and Ni metals and oxides or any other impurity phases was observed in any of the patterns. All the

$$={\frac{0.9\lambda}{\beta\cos\theta}}$$
D = 0.9λ
β cos θ (1)
where D is the grain size diameter, k is the Scherrer constant, θ is the Bragg angle, λ is the X-ray wavelength, and β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak. The results are summarized in Table 1, which are in the range of about 29.5–37 nm. These results show that doping Mn
(with a higher ionic radius) and Ni (with a lower ionic radius) causes the grain size of the structure to increase and decrease about 10%, respectively. Thus, the grain size is likely to depend on the TM ionic radius. The a and c parameters of the unit cell of the films were also calculated using XRD
profiles (Table 1). The results obtained indicate that the c parameter of the unit cell is proportional to the Mn2+ and Ni2+
radii and that the dopants are substituted in the Zn sites.

Surface topology of a thin film can influence its physical properties. One of the qualitative parameters of surface is

$\mu$ 4. 
the surface roughness that generally depends on annealing temperature. The annealing temperature can also affect the grain size of the films [14]. Figures 2a, 2b, and 2c show the AFM images of pure and doped ZnO films. All figures display the 3-D topography of the films which were fitted by polynomials. The roughness average values for the film surfaces are given in Table 1. Roughness of the pure and Ni doped films are nearly close but larger roughness is observed for the Mn-doped film. Surface of the Ni-doped film consists of sharply pointed grain outgrowths. AFM images also show that the Ni-doped film has a smaller grain size.

Figure 3 shows room temperature transmittance spectra of the films. The transmittance was recorded in the wavelength range 200–800 nm with 1 nm step. The average transmittance value for the films was about 80% in the optical range. Mn-doped sample is less transparent than pure and Ni-doped samples. The measured transmittance spectra do not show fluctuation form. The rough surface destroys the interference. This may be caused due to post-thermal treatment.

Direct band gap of the films can be obtained using the following equation [15]:

$$\nu-E_{\mathrm{g}}$$

3%) [19–21]. We also observed red shift in the band gap due to the Mn doping. The decrease in band gap for increasing the Mn content is attributed to the s–d and p–d interactions giving rise to band gap bowing; this has been theoretically explained using the second-order perturbation theory [22].

The optical constants of the films such as refractive index and extinction coefficient are important parameters for optical applications of the materials. These parameters were calculated using the pointwise unconstrained minimization approach. In this algorithm, for any special wavelength, one can obtain a special solution by using the following equation:

$$T_{\mathrm{theo}}(n,k,d,\lambda)={\frac{A^{\prime}x}{B^{\prime}-C^{\prime}x+D^{\prime}x^{2}}}$$  where $T$ is transmittance, and 
B- − C-x + D-x2 (3)
where T is transmittance, and A- = 16ns-n2 + k2, B- = (n + 1) 2 + k2(n + 1)-n + n2s+ k2, C- = -n2 − 1 + k2-n2 − n2s + k2− 2k2-n2s + 12 cosϕ − k2-n2 − n2s + k2 + -n2s + 1-n2 − 1 + k22 sinϕ, D- = (n − 1) 2 + k2(n − 1)-n − n2s+ k2, ϕ = 4πnd/λ, α = 4πk/λ, x = exp(−αd).

$$x=\exp(-\alpha d).$$

In these relations, ns is the real part of the refractive index of substrate. By using (3), if one can determine a curve for *n(λ)*
|Treal*(n,k,d,λ)* − Ttheo*(n,k,d,λ)*| ≈ 0 (4)

$$({\mathfrak{I}})$$

Figures 5 and 6 show the dependence of the refractive index and extinction coefficient of the films on the wavelength. In the transparent region of the transmittance spectrum, the refractive indices of the films do not show remarkable changes, and are almost constant and the same. However, the extinction coefficients of the films slightly increase after about 550 nm, and also the values for extinction coefficients of the films show a little difference which may be due to the different absorption coefficients of the materials.

Near the absorption edge, around 380 nm, there are noticeable changes due to strong interaction of incident light with carriers of the host material.

Figure 7 shows penetration depth of the films as a function of incident light wavelength. The calculated penetration depth for pure sample first starts to increase at the absorption edge and then decreases. For Ni-doped samples, it first starts to increase and then becomes constant. On the other hand, the penetration depth for Mn-doped samples continuously increases up to 750 nm and then becomes constant.

The value of this parameter for all samples is the same at the end of measurement range (about 800 nm). Generally, when Zn sites are replaced by TM ions in the sample, this may cause the sample to undergo trigonal distortion. The trigonally distorted environment near TM ions may affect the optical properties of the samples [23].

Room temperature hysteresis loops (magnetization vs.

magnetic field intensity) for the pure and TM-doped ZnO
films





 thin films are displayed in Figs. 8 and 9a and 9b. As it can be seen in these figures, pure and Ni-doped samples have welldefined hysteresis loops. This means that these films are ferromagnetic even at room temperature. Figure 9b shows the hysteresis loop for Mn-doped film. This indicates a straight line, but the slope is deflected at low fields and is closed at fields lower than 700 Oe, indicating that the paramagnetic component is dominated at room temperature. R.K. Singhal et al. have reported observation of ferromagnetic behavior at 2% Mn-doped and paramagnetic behavior at 4% Mn-doped bulk ZnO [24]. They have concluded that this behavior may be due to presence of higher valance (3 and 4) of Mn in the system. The same result has been reported by other groups
[25, 26] . Figure 8 shows that undoped ZnO film also exhibits a hysteresis loop at room temperature. This behavior has been attributed to the zinc and oxygen vacancy [27–30] .

The Ni-doped film has the highest value for a coercive field and spontaneous moments compared with the corresponding value for undoped ZnO film. However, the saturation value for pure film is higher than that for the Ni-doped sample. Ni- and Mn-doped films show different magnetic behaviors compared to the ZnO film. The extracted results for the magnetic measurements are reported in Table 2.

## 4 Conclusion

Undoped and TM-doped ZnO films were grown by the sol–
gel method. The X-ray diffraction patterns indicated that the Zn0.97TM0.03O films (TM = Mn, Ni) and pure ZnO film have Wurtzite structure with the [002] preferred orientation. Ni-doped film also showed extra (101) and (100) peaks. The average transmittance value for the films was about 80%. It was observed that the band gap of the films vary with TM dopant. The optical constants of the films, refractive index, and extinction coefficient were calculated using pointwise unconstrained minimization algorithm. The penetration depth of the films depends on the dopant at the measurement range. Magnetic measurements revealed ferromagnetic behavior for both Ni-doped and undoped ZnO
films at room temperature but for the Mn-doped film paramagnetic component was dominated at room temperature.
